This chapter describes the C library usually provided with @command{vbcc}.


@section Introduction

To execute code compiled by @command{vbcc}, a library is needed. It
provides basic interfaces to the underlying operating system or
hardware as well as a set of often used functions.

A big part of the library is portable across all architectures. However,
some functions (e.g. for input/output or memory allocation) are
naturally dependent on the operating system or hardware. There are
several sections in this chapter dealing with different versions of
the library.

The library itself often is split into several parts. A startup-code
will do useful initializations, like setting up IO, parsing the command
line or initializing variables and hardware.

The biggest part of the functions will usually be stored in one library file.
The name and format of this file depends on the conventions of the underlying
system (e.g. @file{vc.lib} or @file{libvc.a}).

Often, floating point code (if available) is stored in a different file
(e.g. @file{m.lib} or @file{libm.a}). If floating point is used in an
application, it might be necessary to explicitly link with this library
(e.g. by specifying @file{-lm}).

In many cases, the include files provide special inline-code or similar
optimizations. Therefore, it is recommended to always include the
corresponding include file when using a library function. Even if it
is not necessary in all cases, it may affect the quality of the generated
code.

The library implements the functions specified by ISO9899:1989 as well
as a small number of the new functions from ISO9899:1999.

@section Embedded Systems

This section describes specifics of the C library for embedded systems.

@subsection Startup

The startup is usually split into two parts. The first part is done by
assembly code that produces the object file @file{lib/startup.o}. This
assembly code is usually provided with vbcc and may have to be adapted to
the hardware you are using. The key actions that have to be performed by this
code are:

@table @minus
@item hardware initialization
        It may be necessary to perform some hardware initialization right
        at the beginning, e.g. to configure the memory system. This has to
        be modified by the user.

@item variable initializations
        When running code from ROM, some memory sections have to be
        initialized. Usually, the init-values of initialized variables
        have to be copied from ROM to the data segment and the values of
        un-initialized variables have to be cleared in the bss segment.
        This code is usually provided in the startup code.

@item stack pointer
        The stack pointer has to be set to a suitable memory area.
        The startup code
        will set the stack pointer to the value of the pointer @code{__stack}.
        There is a default stack provided in the C library which will be used
        unless the application defines its own stack using, for example, the
        following code (assuming that the stack grows downwards):
@example
#define STACKSIZE <whatever>

static long mystack[STACKSIZE/sizeof(long)];
char *__stack=((char*)mystack)+STACKSIZE;
@end example

@item calling @code{__main}
        After all the above initializations have been performed, the function
        @code{__main()} has to be called. This function is provided by the
        library and performs high-level initializations, if necessary (mainly
        it calls constructors created by the linker) and will then call the
        user @code{main()} function. Note that the library
        may not work correctly if the user @code{main()} function is called
        directly from the startup code.

@end table

@subsection Heap

When dynamic memory management is used (e.g. by using the @code{malloc()}
function), a heap memory area is needed to allocate memory from. The
@code{malloc()} function assumes that @code{__heapptr} is a variable pointing
to the beginning of the heap memory and that @code{__heapsize} specifies
the size of the heap area in bytes. The library will provide a default heap
memory area that can be replaced by adding, for example, the following file
to the application:
@example
#define HEAPSIZE <whatever>

char __heap[HEAPSIZE],*__heapptr=__heap;
size_t __heapsize=HEAPSIZE;
@end example


@subsection Input/Output

The standard C input/output functions are provided also for embedded systems.
Reading/writing to a stream will be directed to void unless the following
low-level I/O-functions are provided by the application:
@example
int __open(const char *name,const char *mode);
void __close(int h);
size_t __read(int h,char *p,size_t l);
size_t __write(int h,const char *p,size_t l);
@end example

The @code{__open()} function receives a name and a mode string (as in the C
@code{fopen()} function) as arguments and has to return a file-descriptor if
it is possible to open this file. The other functions are equivalent to the
corresponding POSIX functions.

Also, @code{stdin, stdout} and @code{stderr} can be used with the standard
descriptors.

@subsection Floating Point

Whether floating point is supported, depends on the target architecture and
chip. If it is supported, there will usually be a math-library that has to
be linked (using option @option{-lm}) when floating point is used.

@subsection Useless Functions

Of course, some of the C library functions can not be implemented reasonably on
embedded systems. These functions are contained in the library but will
always return an error value. Mainly affected are:

@table @minus
@item locale
@item time
@item signal
@item filesystem functions
@end table

Depending on the hardware provided by a system it is possible to implement
these functions and add them to the application. In this case, the new
functions will be used rather than the default ones returning only error
values.

@subsection Linking/Locating

To produce ROM images (e.g. in the form of absolute ELF executables, Intel
Hex files or Motorola S-Records), the linker is called with a linker script.
This script can be used to join together different sections of the input files
and locate them to suitable absolute memory areas. Also, this linker script
can be used to set symbols that may be used by the application or the startup
code, e.g. addresses of data sections, initialization values or small data
pointers.

Code or data that has to reside at special locations can be put into a special
section using the @code{__section} attribute. This section can then be
placed at the desired location using the linker script.

Usually, an example linker script will be provided. While this is often not
suitable for different chips, it may serve as a starting point.


@section AmigaOS/68k

This section describes specifics of the C library for AmigaOS/68k.
The relevant files are @file{startup.o}, @file{minstart.o},
@file{vc.lib}, @file{vcs.lib}, @file{mieee.lib}, @file{mieees.lib},
@file{m881.lib}, @file{m881s.lib}, @file{m040.lib}, @file{m040s.lib}
@file{amiga.lib}, @file{amigas.lib}, @file{auto.lib} and @file{autos.lib}.

Note that @file{extra.lib} is no longer part of the vbcc distribution.
It was replaced by 'PosixLib', available on Aminet
@file{dev/c/vbcc_PosixLib.lha}, which has a much more comprehensive
support for POSIX and Unix functions.

@subsection Startup

    The startup code currently consists of a slightly modified standard
    Amiga startup (@file{startup.o}). The startup code sets up some
    global variables and initializes stdin, stdout and stderr.
    The exit code closes all open files and frees all memory.
    If you link with a math library the startup/exit code will be taken
    from there if necessary.


@subsection Floating point

    Note that you have to link with a math library if you want to use
    floating point. All math functions, special startup code and
    printf/scanf functions which support floating point are contained in
    the math libraries only.
    At the moment there are three math libraries:
 
@table @file
@item mieee.lib
   This one uses the C= math libraries. The startup code
                    will always open MathIeeeSingBas.library,
                    MathIeeeDoubBas.library and MathIeeeDoubTrans.library.
                    Float return values are passed in d0, double return
                    values are passed in d0/d1.
                    A 68000 is sufficient to use this library.
                    You must not specify @option{-fpu=...}
                    when you use this library.
 
@item m881.lib
    This one uses direct FPU instructions and function
                    return values are passed in fp0. You must have a
                    68020 or higher and an FPU to use this library. You
                    also have to specify @option{-fpu=68881}.
                    Several FPU instructions that have to be emulated on
                    040/060 may be used.
 
@item m040.lib
    This one uses only direct FPU instructions that do not
                    have to be emulated on a 040/060. Other functions use
                    the Motorola emulation routines modified by
                    Aki M Laukkanen.
                    It should be used for programs compiled for 040 or 060
                    with FPU.
                    Return values are passed in fp0.
@end table

Depending on the CPU/FPU selected, #including @file{math.h} will
cause inline-code generated for certain math functions.

@node amiga-stack
@subsection Stack

An application can specify the stack-size needed by defining a variable
@code{__stack} (of type @code{size_t}) with external linkage, e.g.

@example
size_t __stack=65536; /* 64KB stack-size */
@end example

The startup code will check whether the stack-size specified is larger
than the default stack-size (as set in the shell) and switch to a new
stack of appropriate size, if necessary.

If the @option{-stack-check} option is specified when compiling, the
library will check for a stack overflow and abort the program, if the
stack overflows. Note, however, that only code compiled with this
option will be checked. Calls to libraries which have not been compiled
with @option{-stack-check} or calls to OS function may cause a stack
overflow which is not noticed.

Additionally, if @option{-stack-check} is used, the maximum stack-size
used can be read by querying the external variable @code{__stack_usage}.

@example
#include <stdio.h>

extern size_t __stack_usage;

main()
@{
    do_program();
    printf("stack used: %lu\n",(unsigned long)__stack_usage);
@}
@end example

Like above, the stack used by functions not compiled using
@option{-stack-check} or OS functions is ignored.

@subsection Small data model

When using the small data model of the 68k series CPUs, you also have
to link with appropriate libraries. Most libraries documented here are
also available as small data versions (with an 's' attached to the
file name). Exceptions are the math libraries.

To compile and link a program using the small data model a command like

@example
vc test.c -o test -sd -lvcs -lamigas
@end example

might be used.

@subsection Restrictions

The following list contains some restrictions of this version of the
library:

@table @code

@item tmpfile()
The @code{tmpfile()} function always returns an error.

@item clock()
The @code{clock()} function always returns -1. This is correct,
according to the C standard, because on AmigaOS it is not possible to
obtain the time used by the calling process.

@end table

@node Minimal startup
@subsection Minimal startup 

If you want to write programs that use only Amiga functions and none from
vc.lib you can use @file{minstart.o} instead of @file{startup.o} and
produce smaller executables.
 
This is only useful for people who know enough about the Amiga shared
libraries, the stubs in amiga.lib etc. If you do not know enough about
those things better forget minstart at all.
 
This startup code does not set up all the things needed by vc.lib, so you
must not use most of those functions (string and ctype funtions are ok,
but most other functions - especially I/O and memory handling - must not
be used).
@code{exit()} is supplied by minstart and can be used.
 
The command line is not parsed, but passed to @code{main()} as a single
string,
so you can declare main as
@code{int main(char *command)} or @code{int main(void)}.
 
Also no Amiga libraries are opened (but @code{SysBase} ist set up), so you
have to define and open @code{DOSBase} yourself if you need it.
If you want to use floating point with the IEEE libraries you have to
define and open MathIeeeSingBas.library, MathIeeeDoubBas.library and
MathIeeeDoubTrans.library (in this order!) and link with mieee.lib (if
compiled for FPU this is not needed).
 
A hello world using minstart could look like this:

@example 
#include <proto/exec.h>
#include <proto/dos.h>
 
struct DosLibrary *DOSBase;
 
main()
@{
    if(DOSBase=(struct DosLibrary *)OpenLibrary("dos.library",0))@{
        Write(Output(),"Hello, world!\n",14);
        CloseLibrary((struct Library *)DOSBase);
    @}
    return 0;
@}

@end example

This can yield an executable of under 300 bytes when compiled with
@option{-sc -sd -O2} and linked with @file{minstart.o} and @code{amigas.lib}
(using @command{vlink} - may not work with other linkers).

@subsection amiga.lib

To write programs accessing AmigaOS (rather than standard C functions
only), a replacement for the original (copyrighted) @file{amiga.lib}
is provided with @command{vbcc}. This replacement is adapted to vbcc,
does not cause collisions with some functions (e.g. @code{sprintf})
provided by the original @file{amiga.lib} and is available in
small data. It is recommended to always use this library rather than
the original version.

Additionally, there are header files (in the @file{proto}- and
@file{inline}-subdirectories) which cause inlined calls to Amiga
library functions.

Specify @option{-lamiga} to link with @file{amiga.lib}.

@node auto.lib
@subsection auto.lib

    To link with @file{auto.lib} (or the small data version
    @file{autos.lib}) specify
    the @option{-lauto} or @option{-lautos} option to @command{vc}.
 
    When you are calling a standard Amiga library function and do not
    have defined the corresponding library base then the library base
    as well as code to open/close it will be taken from @file{auto.lib}.
 
    By default, @file{auto.lib} will try to open any library version. If you
    need at least a certain version you can define and set a variable
    _<library-base>Ver with external linkage, e.g. (on file-scope):

@example 
        int _IntuitionBaseVer = 39;
@end example

    Note that your program will abort before reaching @code{main()} if one
    of the libraries cannot be opened. Also note that the dos.library
    will be openened by the standard startup code, not by auto.lib.
    This means you have to open dos.library yourself, when linking
    with @file{minstart.o}. 


@section PowerUp/PPC

This section describes specifics of the C library for PowerUp/PPC.
The relevant files are @file{startup.o}, @file{minstart.o},
@file{libvc.a}, @file{libvcs.a}, @file{libm.a}, @file{libms.a}
@file{libamiga.a}, @file{libamigas.a},
@file{libauto.a} and @file{libautos.a}.

Note that @file{libextra.a} is no longer part of the vbcc distribution.
It was replaced by 'PosixLib', available on Aminet
@file{dev/c/vbcc_PosixLib.lha}, which has a much more comprehensive
support for POSIX and Unix functions.

@subsection Startup
 
    The startup code @file{startup.o} sets up some
    global variables and initializes stdin, stdout and stderr.
    The exit code closes all open files and frees all memory.
    If you link with a math library the startup/exit code will be taken
    from there if necessary.

@subsection Floating point
 
    Note that you have to link with a math library if you want to use
    floating point. All math functions, special startup code and
    printf/scanf functions which support floating point are contained in
    the math libraries only.

    The math library (@file{libm.a}) is linked against the floating point
    library libmoto by Motorola.

Depending on the CPU/FPU selected, #including @file{math.h} will
cause inline-code generated for certain math functions.

@subsection Stack

Stack-handling is similar to AmigaOS/68k (@xref{amiga-stack}).
The only difference is that stack-swapping cannot be done. If the
default stack-size is less than the stack-size specified with
@code{__stack} the program will abort.

@subsection Small data model
 
When using the small data model of the PPC series CPUs, you also have
to link with appropriate libraries. Most libraries documented here are
also available as small data versions (with an 's' attached to the

@end table

@subsection Minimal startup

The provided minimal startup code (@file{minstart.o}) is used
similarly like the one for 68k (@xref{Minimal startup}). Only use
it if you know what you are doing.

@subsection libamiga.a

To write programs accessing AmigaOS (rather than standard C functions
only), a replacement for the original (copyrighted) @file{amiga.lib}
is provided with @command{vbcc}. This replacement (@file{libamiga.a})
automatically performs a necessary context switch to the 68k to execute
the system call. Furthermore, it is adapted to vbcc,
does not cause collisions with some functions (e.g. @code{sprintf})
provided by the original @file{amiga.lib} and is available in
small data.

Specify @option{-lamiga} to link with @file{libamiga.a}.
 
@subsection libauto.a
 
This library corresponds to the AmigaOS/68k version (@xref{auto.lib}).

@section WarpOS/PPC
 
This section describes specifics of the C library for WarpOS/PPC.
The relevant files are @file{startup.o}, 
@file{vc.lib}, @file{m.lib}, @file{amiga.lib} and @file{auto.lib}.

    Note that you have to link with a math library if you want to use
    floating point. All math functions, special startup code and
    printf/scanf functions which support floating point are contained in
    the math libraries only.

    The math library (@file{m.lib}) contains functions from Sun's
    portable floating point library. Additionally, there is a
    @command{vbcc} version of Andreas Heumann's @file{ppcmath.lib}.
    These routines are linked against Motorola's floating point
    routines optimized for PowerPC and therefore are much faster.

    To make use of this library, link with @file{ppcmath.lib} before
    @file{m.lib}, e.g.

@example
    vc test.c -lppcmath -lm
@end example
    

 
Depending on the CPU/FPU selected, #including @file{math.h} will
cause inline-code generated for certain math functions.

The math library (@file{libm.a}) is linked against the floating point
library libmoto by Motorola.
 
Depending on the CPU/FPU selected, #including @file{math.h} will
cause inline-code generated for certain math functions.

@subsection Stack

There is no automatic stack extension for AmigaOS 4! This should be
done automatically by the operating system.

@subsection Small data model
 
When using the small data model of the PPC series CPUs, you also have
to link with appropriate libraries. Most libraries documented here are
also available as small data versions (with an 's' attached to the
file name). Exceptions are the math libraries.
 
To compile and link a program using the small data model a command like
 
@example
vc test.c -o test -sd -lvcs -lamigas
@end example
 
might be used.

@subsection Dynamic linking
Since @file{elf.library} @code{V52.2} AmigaOS4 supports dynamic linking with
shared object files (@file{.so} extension), similar to Unix. The default
behaviour is to prefer linking against a shared object over a static
library. To force static linking you might want to give the
@option{-static} option to the @file{vc} frontend.

@subsection Restrictions
 
The following list contains some restrictions of this version of the
library:
 
@table @code
 
@item tmpfile()
The @code{tmpfile()} function always returns an error.
 
@item clock()
The @code{clock()} function always returns -1. This is correct,
according to the C standard, because on AmigaOS it is not possible to
obtain the time used by the calling process.

@item Small data in dynamically linked executables
There is a bug in @file{elf.library} @code{V52.4} (and earlier), which
doesn't load @code{.sdata} and @code{.sbss} as a contiguous block into
memory, when the executable requires dynamic linking. I decided against
writing a workaround, as the bug should be fixed in OS4.

@end table

@subsection libamiga.a

In contrast to other amigalibs the OS4 @file{libamiga.a} doesn't contain
any stubs for calling system functions. AmigaOS 4 system calls are done
through special macros in the SDK's interface header files.

The library only includes some remaining amigalib functions, not already
integrated into the OS, like @code{CreateIO()}, but its use is discouraged.

Specify @option{-lamiga} to link with @file{libamiga.a}.


@subsection libauto.a

Auto-open -close functions for the following libraries are included:

@code{Asl, CyberGfx, DataTypes, Dos, GadTools, Graphics, Icon, IFFParse,
      Intuition, Locale, LowLevel, Picasso96, BSDSocket, Utility, Workbench}

Note that gcc's @file{libauto.a} doesn't include CyberGfx.
 

@subsection newlib

@subsubsection Introduction

    newlib.library is a shared AmigaOS4 library, which is covered by
    several BSD like licenses,
    and includes standard ANSI and POSIX functions as well as some
    functions common in Unix, BSD and similar operating systems. It is
    part of the OS4 SDK.

    The config file @file{newlib} will be created on installation to
    use the paths for header files and libraries pointing to the
    newlib from the SDK. 

    What are the main differences between vclib and newlib?

@itemize @minus
@item vclib contains (almost) only standard ANSI functions. If you want
      to port Unix programs you will probably miss a lot of functions.
      Also newlib supports things like mapping Unix directory paths to
      Amiga paths or expanding wildcards in command lines automatically.
 
@item Programs compiled for newlib will be shorter because the code for all
      functions is not contained in the executable itself.

@item Programs compiled for newlib will need the shared object
      @file{libc.so} present when started.

@item Programs compiled for newlib will probably need more memory because
      the entire (rather large) @file{libc.so} will be loaded into memory.
      With vclib only the functions your program uses will be in ram.
      However if you have several programs using newlib at the same
      time only one copy of @file{libc.so} should be loaded.
@end itemize

    Things you should note:
 
@itemize @minus
@item With newlib you do not need extra math-libraries.
 
@item You must link with a vbcc-specific @file{startup.o} from the newlib
      @file{lib/} directory as startup code.
      The config-file @file{newlib} will usually take care of this.
 
@item You _must_ use the newlib-includes from the SDK
      rather than the ones which are for vc.lib.
      The config-file @file{newlib} will usually take care of this.
@end itemize


@subsubsection Usage

To compile a program to use newlib for OS4 you must make sure the proper
config-file (@file{newlib}) is used, e.g.
 
@example
        vc +newlib hello.c
@end example

With a new SDK this will usually generate a dynamically linked executable,
which requires @file{libc.so}. To force a statically linked executable:

@example
        vc +newlib -static hello.c
@end example


@section Atari TOS/MiNT

This section describes specifics of the C library for Atari TOS and MiNT.
M680x0 processors are supported by the target @file{m68k-atari}, while
ColdFire processors are supported by the target @file{cf-atari}. Both
share the same startup-code and are based on common library sources and
header files. Executables linked with this C library run on plain TOS as
well as on MiNT, without modifications.

The relevant files are @file{startup.o}, @file{minstart.o},
@file{libvc.a}, @file{libvc16.a}, @file{libm.a}, @file{libm16.a}.

The following config files are available:
@table @code
@item tos
  M68k 32-bit @code{int}
@item tos16
  M68k 16-bit @code{int}
@item toscf
  ColdFire 32-bit @code{int}
@end table

@subsection Startup
 
The startup code @file{startup.o} sets up some
global variables and initializes stdin, stdout and stderr and returns
the unneeded memory to the system.
The exit code closes all open files and frees all memory.

@subsection Floating point

Note that you have to link with a math library if you want to use
floating point. All math functions, special startup code and
printf/scanf functions which support floating point are contained in
the math libraries only.

At the moment (@file{libm.a}) is a soft-float library, which is compatible
with all the Atari models without an FPU. There may be real FPU support
in future updates.

@subsection Stack

The default stack size is 64k. There is a MiNT tool called @file{stack}
which can adjust the stack size of an executable to any value, by looking
for a symbol named @code{__stksize} (defined by vclib's startup code).

Additionally the required stack size can be specified by defining a
variable @code{__stack} (of type @code{size_t}) with external linkage, as
in other vbcc targets.

@subsection 16-bit integer model

The default libraries use 32-bit @code{int} types, but you may want to
use 16-bit @code{int} types for compatibility reasons. In this case you
have to specify the config file @code{tos16} and link with the appropriate
16-bit libraries (which have a '@file{16}' attached to their name).

To compile and link a program using 16-bit integers a command like

@example
vc +tos16 test.c -o test -lm16 -lvc16
@end example
 
may be used. There are no 16-bit versions for ColdFire targets,
because this is strictly a 32-bit CPU.

@subsection Restrictions
 
The following list contains some restrictions of this version of the
library:
 
@table @code
 
@item tmpfile()
The @code{tmpfile()} function always returns an error.
 
@item clock()
The @code{clock()} function always returns -1. This is correct,
according to the C standard, because neither under TOS nor under MiNT it
is possible to obtain the time used by the calling process.

@end table

@section VideoCore/Linux

This section describes specifics of the C library for VideoCore under Linux.

The relevant files are @code{vcload}, @file{startup.o},
@file{libvc.a}, @file{libm.a}, @file{libms.a}.

The config file @code{vc4-linux} is part of the library.

@subsection Startup
 
The startup code @file{startup.o} sets up stack and heap and provides
a function @code{__armcall()} to transfer control to the loader on
the ARM side.
The startup process calls constructors to set up some
global variables and initialize stdin, stdout and stderr if needed.

@subsection Floating point

Note that you have to link with a math library if you want to use
floating point operations that are not natively implemented.
All math functions, special startup code and
printf/scanf functions which support floating point are contained in
the math libraries only.

@subsection Stack

The library contains a default stack of 32KB. If another size is needed,
you can add the following to your project:

@example
        .align  4
        .space  <desired-size, suitably aligned>
___stackend:
        .global ___stackend
@end example

@subsection Heap

Currently, a global variable of 16KB is used to get memory for
malloc() etc.  If another size is needed,
you can add the following to your project:

@example
#define HEAPSIZE <desired size>

char __heap[HEAPSIZE],*__heapptr=__heap;
size_t __heapsize=HEAPSIZE;
@end example

Note that this mechanism will likely be changed in the future!

@subsection System Calls

To access system functions from the VideoCore-side, the function
@code{__armcall()} can be used. It will save the current context and return
to the loader. Registers @code{r0-r5} (the function arguments) will be saved
and are available to the loader. The loader can then execute the system
call and resume execution, passing the return value of the system
function.

Resuming is done by calling the image with offset 2.

This functionality can also be used for debugging purposes.

@subsection Loader

A loader is required to execute VideoCore code from the ARM side. For
standalone VideoCore code, the provided loader can be used. Usually, it
will be necessary to adapt the loader to communicate between ARM and
VideoCore side during runtime.

@subsubsection Object Format

Currently, the loader loads an simple binary image that must be pc-relative
and located to address 0x00000000. Additionally, if present, a file
with extension @file{.reltext} will be loaded for some limited
relocation. This file contains a 32bit word containing the number of
relocations followed by n 32bit words containing an offset. For each
offset, the address will be relocated to the image load address.

@subsubsection Command line arguments

@code{vcload [-debug] [-cache] [-offset] <image-name>}

The loader currently has the following options:

@table @code

@item -debug

    The loader will enter debug mode (see below).

@item -cache

    The loader will set the LSB in the start address when executing
    code. This is supposed to inhibit a cache flush.

    Just for testing!

@item -offset

    The loader will allocate 1 KB more memory than required and leaves
    this space unused at the beginning of the allocated memory.

    Just for testing!

@end table

@subsubsection Debug Mode

In debug mode, the loader will wait for user input before starting the
VideoCore code as well as after every @code{__armcall}.

The following commands are available:

@table @code
@item w <addr> [<num>]
      Display <num> 32bit words starting at <addr>.
      <addr> must be the offset into the image. If <num> is omitted,
      one unit is displayed.

      If one word is displayed, it is additionally displayed translated
      as an offset into the image.

@item h <addr> [<num>]
      Display <num> 16bit halfwords starting at <addr>.
      <addr> must be the offset into the image. If <num> is omitted,
      one unit is displayed.

@item b <addr> [<num>]
      Display <num> 8bit bytes starting at <addr>.
      <addr> must be the offset into the image. If <num> is omitted,
      one unit is displayed.

@item c
      Start/continue execution.

@item q
      Quit.

@item bp <addr>
      Set a breakpoint at <addr>.

      This is currently a very crude implementation. It will just write
      a branch to @code{__armcall()} to <addr>. If everything works well,
      you will end in the debugger if <addr> is reached. However, the
      arguments passed are random (and might be dangerous syscalls by 
      accident). Also, the old code at this address is currently not
      restored.

      As a result, you must not continue execution after hitting a
      breakpoint!
