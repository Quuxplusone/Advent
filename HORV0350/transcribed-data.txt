     126FARTHEST REACHES OF THE CAVERN WITH A BLOOD-RED GLARE, GIVING EVERY-
     126THING AN EERIE, MACABRE APPEARANCE.  THE AIR IS FILLED WITH FLICKERING
     126SPARKS OF ASH AND A HEAVY SMELL OF BRIMSTONE.  THE WALLS ARE HOT TO
     126THE TOUCH, AND THE THUNDERING OF THE VOLCANO DROWNS OUT ALL OTHER
     126SOUNDS.  EMBEDDED IN THE JAGGED ROOF FAR OVERHEAD ARE MYRIAD TWISTED
     126FORMATIONS COMPOSED OF PURE WHITE ALABASTER, WHICH SCATTER THE MURKY

     126GORGE, FILLED WITH A BIZARRE CHAOS OF TORTURED ROCK WHICH SEEMS TO
     126HAVE BEEN CRAFTED BY THE DEVIL HIMSELF.  AN IMMENSE RIVER OF FIRE
     126CRASHES OUT FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE VOLCANO, BURNS ITS WAY THROUGH THE
     126GORGE, AND PLUMMETS INTO A BOTTOMLESS PIT FAR OFF TO YOUR LEFT.  TO
     126THE RIGHT, AN IMMENSE GEYSER OF BLISTERING STEAM ERUPTS CONTINUOUSLY
     126FROM A BARREN ISLAND IN THE CENTER OF A SULFUROUS LAKE, WHICH BUBBLES
     126OMINOUSLY.  THE FAR RIGHT WALL IS AFLAME WITH AN INCANDESCENCE OF ITS

       2A LITTLE DWARF WITH A BIG KNIFE BLOCKS YOUR WAY.
       3A LITTLE DWARF JUST WALKED AROUND A CORNER, SAW YOU, THREW A LITTLE
       3AXE AT YOU WHICH MISSED, CURSED, AND RAN AWAY.
       4THERE IS A THREATENING LITTLE DWARF IN THE ROOM WITH YOU!
       5ONE SHARP NASTY KNIFE IS THROWN AT YOU!
       6NONE OF THEM HIT YOU!
       7ONE OF THEM GETS YOU!
       8A HOLLOW VOICE SAYS "PLUGH".
       9THERE IS NO WAY TO GO THAT DIRECTION.
      10I AM UNSURE HOW YOU ARE FACING.  USE COMPASS POINTS OR NEARBY OBJECTS.
      11I DON'T KNOW IN FROM OUT HERE.  USE COMPASS POINTS OR NAME SOMETHING
      11IN THE GENERAL DIRECTION YOU WANT TO GO.
      12I DON'T KNOW HOW TO APPLY THAT WORD HERE.
      13I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT!
      14I'M GAME.  WOULD YOU CARE TO EXPLAIN HOW?
      15SORRY, BUT I AM NOT ALLOWED TO GIVE MORE DETAIL.  I WILL REPEAT THE
      15LONG DESCRIPTION OF YOUR LOCATION.
      16IT IS NOW PITCH DARK.  IF YOU PROCEED YOU WILL LIKELY FALL INTO A PIT.
      17IF YOU PREFER, SIMPLY TYPE W RATHER THAN WEST.
      18ARE YOU TRYING TO CATCH THE BIRD?
      19THE BIRD IS FRIGHTENED RIGHT NOW AND YOU CANNOT CATCH IT NO MATTER
      19WHAT YOU TRY.  PERHAPS YOU MIGHT TRY LATER.
      20ARE YOU TRYING TO SOMEHOW DEAL WITH THE SNAKE?
      21YOU CAN'T KILL THE SNAKE, OR DRIVE IT AWAY, OR AVOID IT, OR ANYTHING
      21LIKE THAT.  THERE IS A WAY TO GET BY, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE THE NECESSARY
      21RESOURCES RIGHT NOW.
      22DO YOU REALLY WANT TO QUIT NOW?
      23YOU FELL INTO A PIT AND BROKE EVERY BONE IN YOUR BODY!
      24YOU ARE ALREADY CARRYING IT!
      25YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!
      26THE BIRD WAS UNAFRAID WHEN YOU ENTERED, BUT AS YOU APPROACH IT BECOMES
      26DISTURBED AND YOU CANNOT CATCH IT.
      27YOU CAN CATCH THE BIRD, BUT YOU CANNOT CARRY IT.
      28THERE IS NOTHING HERE WITH A LOCK!
      29YOU AREN'T CARRYING IT!
      30THE LITTLE BIRD ATTACKS THE GREEN SNAKE, AND IN AN ASTOUNDING FLURRY
      30DRIVES THE SNAKE AWAY.

      31YOU HAVE NO KEYS!
      32IT HAS NO LOCK.
      33I DON'T KNOW HOW TO LOCK OR UNLOCK SUCH A THING.
      34IT WAS ALREADY LOCKED.
      35THE GRATE IS NOW LOCKED.
      36THE GRATE IS NOW UNLOCKED.
      37IT WAS ALREADY UNLOCKED.
      38YOU HAVE NO SOURCE OF LIGHT.
      39YOUR LAMP IS NOW ON.
      40YOUR LAMP IS NOW OFF.
      41THERE IS NO WAY TO GET PAST THE BEAR TO UNLOCK THE CHAIN, WHICH IS
      41PROBABLY JUST AS WELL.
      42NOTHING HAPPENS.
      43WHERE?
      44THERE IS NOTHING HERE TO ATTACK.
      45THE LITTLE BIRD IS NOW DEAD.  ITS BODY DISAPPEARS.
      46ATTACKING THE SNAKE BOTH DOESN'T WORK AND IS VERY DANGEROUS.
      47YOU KILLED A LITTLE DWARF.
      48YOU ATTACK A LITTLE DWARF, BUT HE DODGES OUT OF THE WAY.
      49WITH WHAT?  YOUR BARE HANDS?
      50GOOD TRY, BUT THAT IS AN OLD WORN-OUT MAGIC WORD.
      51I KNOW OF PLACES, ACTIONS, AND THINGS.  MOST OF MY VOCABULARY
      51DESCRIBES PLACES AND IS USED TO MOVE YOU THERE.  TO MOVE, TRY WORDS
      51LIKE FOREST, BUILDING, DOWNSTREAM, ENTER, EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH,
      51UP, OR DOWN.  I KNOW ABOUT A FEW SPECIAL OBJECTS, LIKE A BLACK ROD
      51HIDDEN IN THE CAVE.  THESE OBJECTS CAN BE MANIPULATED USING SOME OF
      51THE ACTION WORDS THAT I KNOW.  USUALLY YOU WILL NEED TO GIVE BOTH THE
      51OBJECT AND ACTION WORDS (IN EITHER ORDER), BUT SOMETIMES I CAN INFER
      51THE OBJECT FROM THE VERB ALONE.  SOME OBJECTS ALSO IMPLY VERBS; IN
      51PARTICULAR, "INVENTORY" IMPLIES "TAKE INVENTORY", WHICH CAUSES ME TO
      51GIVE YOU A LIST OF WHAT YOU'RE CARRYING.  THE OBJECTS HAVE SIDE
      51EFFECTS; FOR INSTANCE, THE ROD SCARES THE BIRD.  USUALLY PEOPLE HAVING
      51TROUBLE MOVING JUST NEED TO TRY A FEW MORE WORDS.  USUALLY PEOPLE
      51TRYING UNSUCCESSFULLY TO MANIPULATE AN OBJECT ARE ATTEMPTING SOMETHING
      51BEYOND THEIR (OR MY!) CAPABILITIES AND SHOULD TRY A COMPLETELY
      51DIFFERENT TACK.  TO SPEED THE GAME YOU CAN SOMETIMES MOVE LONG
      51DISTANCES WITH A SINGLE WORD.  FOR EXAMPLE, "BUILDING" USUALLY GETS
      51YOU TO THE BUILDING FROM ANYWHERE ABOVE GROUND EXCEPT WHEN LOST IN THE
      51FOREST.  ALSO, NOTE THAT CAVE PASSAGES TURN A LOT, AND THAT LEAVING A
      51ROOM TO THE NORTH DOES NOT GUARANTEE ENTERING THE NEXT FROM THE SOUTH.
      51GOOD LUCK!
      52IT MISSES!
      53IT GETS YOU!
      54OK
      55YOU CAN'T UNLOCK THE KEYS.
      56YOU HAVE CRAWLED AROUND IN SOME LITTLE HOLES AND WOUND UP BACK IN THE
      56MAIN PASSAGE.
      57I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE CAVE IS, BUT HEREABOUTS NO STREAM CAN RUN ON
      57THE SURFACE FOR LONG.  I WOULD TRY THE STREAM.
      58I NEED MORE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS TO DO THAT.
      59I CAN ONLY TELL YOU WHAT YOU SEE AS YOU MOVE ABOUT AND MANIPULATE
      59THINGS.  I CANNOT TELL YOU WHERE REMOTE THINGS ARE.
      60I DON'T KNOW THAT WORD.
      61WHAT?
      62ARE YOU TRYING TO GET INTO THE CAVE?
      63THE GRATE IS VERY SOLID AND HAS A HARDENED STEEL LOCK.  YOU CANNOT
      63ENTER WITHOUT A KEY, AND THERE ARE NO KEYS NEARBY.  I WOULD RECOMMEND
==p116==

      63LOOKING ELSEWHERE FOR THE KEYS.
      64THE TREES OF THE FOREST ARE LARGE HARDWOOD OAK AND MAPLE, WITH AN
      64OCCASIONAL GROVE OF PINE OR SPRUCE.  THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF UNDER-
      64GROWTH, LARGELY BIRCH AND ASH SAPLINGS PLUS NONDESCRIPT BUSHES OF
      64VARIOUS SORTS.  THIS TIME OF YEAR VISIBILITY IS QUITE RESTRICTED BY
      64ALL THE LEAVES, BUT TRAVEL IS QUITE EASY IF YOU DETOUR AROUND THE
      64SPRUCE AND BERRY BUSHES.
      65WELCOME TO ADVENTURE!!  WOULD YOU LIKE INSTRUCTIONS?
      66DDIGGING WITHOUT A SHOVEL IS QUITE IMPRACTICAL.  EVEN WITH A SHOVEL
      66PROGRESS IS UNLIKELY.
      67BLASTING REQUIRES DYNAMITE.
      68I'M AS CONFUSED AS YOU ARE.
      69MIST IS A WHITE VAPOR, USUALLY WATER, SEEN FROM TIME TO TIME IN
      69CAVERNS.  IT CAN BE FOUND ANYWHERE BUT IS FREQUENTLY A SIGN OF A DEEP
      69PIT LEADING DOWN TO WATER.
      70YOUR FEET ARE NOW WET.
      71I THINK I JUST LOST MY APPETITE.
      72THANK YOU, IT WAS DELICIOUS!
      73YOU HAVE TAKEN A DRINK FROM THE STREAM.  THE WATER TASTES STRONGLY OF
      73MINERALS, BUT IS NOT UNPLEASANT.  IT IS EXTREMELY COLD.
      74THE BOTTLE OF WATER IS NOW EMPTY.
      75RUBBING THE ELECTRIC LAMP IS NOT PARTICULARLY REWARDING.  ANYWAY,
      75NOTHING EXCITING HAPPENS.
      76PECULIAR.  NOTHING UNEXPECTED HAPPENS.
      77YOUR BOTTLE IS EMPTY AND THE GROUND IS WET.
      78YOU CAN'T POUR THAT.
      79WATCH IT!
      80WHICH WAY?
      81OH DEAR, YOU SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN YOURSELF KILLED.  I MIGHT BE ABLE TO
      81HELP YOU OUT, BUT I'VE NEVER REALLY DONE THIS BEFORE.  DO YOU WANT ME
      81TO TRY TO REINCARNATE YOU?
      82ALL RIGHT.  BUT DON'T BLAME ME IF SOMETHING GOES WR......
      82                    --- POOF!! ---
      82YOU ARE ENGULFED IN A CLOUD OF ORANGE SMOKE.  COUGHING AND GASPING,
      82YOU EMERGE FROM THE SMOKE AND FIND....
      83YOU CLUMSY OAF, YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN!  I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I CAN
      83KEEP THIS UP.  DO YOU WANT ME TO TRY REINCARNATING YOU AGAIN?
      84OKAY, NOW WHERE DID I PUT MY ORANGE SMOKE?....  >POOF!<
      84EVERYTHING DISAPPEARS IN A DENSE CLOUD OF ORANGE SMOKE.
      85NOW YOU'VE REALLY DONE IT!  I'M OUT OF ORANGE SMOKE!  YOU DON'T EXPECT
      85ME TO DO A DECENT REINCARNATION WITHOUT ANY ORANGE SMOKE, DO YOU?
      86OKAY, IF YOU'RE SO SMART, DO IT YOURSELF!  I'M LEAVING!
      90>>> MESSAGES 81 THRU 90 ARE RESERVED FOR "OBITUARIES". <<<
      91SORRY, BUT I NO LONGER SEEM TO REMEMBER HOW IT WAS YOU GOT HERE.
      92YOU CAN'T CARRY ANYTHING MORE.  YOU'LL HAVE TO DROP SOMETHING FIRST.
      93YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH A LOCKED STEEL GRATE!
      94I BELIEVE WHAT YOU WANT IS RIGHT HERE WITH YOU.
      95YOU DON'T FIT THROUGH A TWO-INCH SLIT!
      96I RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST YOU GO ACROSS THE BRIDGE INSTEAD OF JUMPING.
      97THERE IS NO WAY ACROSS THE FISSURE.
      98YOU'RE NOT CARRYING ANYTHING.
      99YOU ARE CURRENTLY HOLDING THE FOLLOWING:
     100IT'S NOT HUNGRY (IT'S MERELY PININ' FOR THE FJORDS).  BESIDES, YOU
     100HAVE NO BIRD SEED.
     101THE SNAKE HAS NOW DEVOURED YOUR BIRD.
     102THERE'S NOTHING HERE IT WANTS TO EAT (EXCEPT PERHAPS YOU).
     103YOU FOOL, DWARVES EAT ONLY COAL!  NOW YOU'VE MADE HIM *REALLY* MAD!!

     104YOU HAVE NOTHING IN WHICH TO CARRY IT.
     105YOUR BOTTLE IS ALREADY FULL.
     106THERE IS NOTHING HERE WITH WHICH TO FILL THE BOTTLE.
     107YOUR BOTTLE IS NOW FULL OF WATER.
     108YOUR BOTTLE IS NOW FULL OF OIL.
     109YOU CAN'T FILL THAT.
     110DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!
     111THE DOOR IS EXTREMELY RUSTY AND REFUSES TO OPEN.
     112THE PLANT INDIGNANTLY SHAKES THE OIL OFF ITS LEAVES AND ASKS, "WATER?"
     113THE HINGES ARE QUITE THOROUGHLY RUSTED NOW AND WON'T BUDGE.
     114THE OIL HAS FREED UP THE HINGES SO THAT THE DOOR WILL NOW MOVE,
     114ALTHOUGH IT REQUIRES SOME EFFORT.
     115THE PLANT HAS EXCEPTIONALLY DEEP ROOTS AND CANNOT BE PULLED FREE.
     116THE DWARVES' KNIVES VANISH AS THEY STRIKE THE WALLS OF THE CAVE.
     117SOMETHING YOU'RE CARRYING WON'T FIT THROUGH THE TUNNEL WITH YOU.
     117YOU'D BEST TAKE INVENTORY AND DROP SOMETHING.
     118YOU CAN'T FIT THIS FIVE-FOOT CLAM THROUGH THAT LITTLE PASSAGE!
     119YOU CAN'T FIT THIS FIVE-FOOT OYSTER THROUGH THAT LITTLE PASSAGE!
     120I ADVISE YOU TO PUT DOWN THE CLAM BEFORE OPENING IT.  >STRAIN!<
     121I ADVISE YOU TO PUT DOWN THE OYSTER BEFORE OPENING IT.  >WRENCH!<
     122YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING STRONG ENOUGH TO OPEN THE CLAM.
     123YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING STRONG ENOUGH TO OPEN THE OYSTER.
     124A GLISTENING PEARL FALLS OUT OF THE CLAM AND ROLLS AWAY.  GOODNESS,
     124THIS MUST REALLY BE AN OYSTER.  (I NEVER WAS VERY GOOD AT IDENTIFYING
     124BIVALVES.)  WHATEVER IT IS, IT HAS NOW SNAPPED SHUT AGAIN.
     125THE OYSTER CREAKS OPEN, REVEALING NOTHING BUT OYSTER INSIDE.  IT
     125PROMPTLY SNAPS SHUT AGAIN.
     126YOU HAVE CRAWLED AROUND IN SOME LITTLE HOLES AND FOUND YOUR WAY
     126BLOCKED BY A RECENT CAVE-IN.  YOU ARE NOW BACK IN THE MAIN PASSAGE.
     127THERE ARE FAINT RUSTLING NOISES FROM THE DARKNESS BEHIND YOU.
     128OUT FROM THE SHADOWS BEHIND YOU POUNCES A BEARDED PIRATE!  "HAR, HAR,"
     128HE CHORTLES, "I'LL JUST TAKE ALL THIS BOOTY AND HIDE IT AWAY WITH ME
     128CHEST DEEP IN THE MAZE!"  HE SNATCHES YOUR TREASURE AND VANISHES INTO
     128THE GLOOM.
     129A SEPULCHRAL VOICE REVERBERATING THROUGH THE CAVE, SAYS, "CAVE CLOSING
     129SOON.  ALL ADVENTURERS EXIT IMMEDIATELY THROUGH MAIN OFFICE."
     130A MYSTERIOUS RECORDED VOICE GROANS INTO LIFE AND ANNOUNCES:
     130   "THIS EXIT IS CLOSED.  PLEASE LEAVE VIA MAIN OFFICE."
     131IT LOOKS AS THOUGH YOU'RE DEAD.  WELL, SEEING AS HOW IT'S SO CLOSE TO
     131CLOSING TIME ANYWAY, I THINK WE'LL JUST CALL IT A DAY.
     132THE SEPULCHRAL VOICE ENTONES, "THE CAVE IS NOW CLOSED."  AS THE ECHOES
     132FADE, THERE IS A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT (AND A SMALL PUFF OF ORANGE
     132SMOKE). . . .    AS YOUR EYES REFOCUS, YOU LOOK AROUND AND FIND...
     133THERE IS A LOUD EXPLOSION, AND A TWENTY-FOOT HOLE APPEARS IN THE FAR
     133WALL, BURYING THE DWARVES IN THE RUBBLE.  YOU MARCH THROUGH THE HOLE
     133AND FIND YOURSELF IN THE MAIN OFFICE, WHERE A CHEERING BAND OF
     133FRIENDLY ELVES CARRY THE CONQUERING ADVENTURER OFF INTO THE SUNSET.
     134THERE IS A LOUD EXPLOSION, AND A TWENTY-FOOT HOLE APPEARS IN THE FAR
     134WALL, BURYING THE SNAKES IN THE RUBBLE.  A RIVER OF MOLTEN LAVA POURS
     134IN THROUGH THE HOLE, DESTROYING EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH, INCLUDING YOU!
     135THERE IS A LOUD EXPLOSION, AND YOU ARE SUDDENLY SPLASHED ACROSS THE
     135WALLS OF THE ROOM.
     136THE RESULTING RUCKUS HAS AWAKENED THE DWARVES.  THERE ARE NOW SEVERAL
     136THREATENING LITTLE DWARVES IN THE ROOM WITH YOU!  MOST OF THEM THROW
     136KNIVES AT YOU!  ALL OF THEM GET YOU!
     137OH, LEAVE THE POOR UNHAPPY BIRD ALONE.
     138I DARESAY WHATEVER YOU WANT IS AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

     139I DON'T KNOW THE WORD "STOP".  USE "QUIT" IF YOU WANT TO GIVE UP.
     140YOU CAN'T GET THERE FROM HERE.
     141YOU ARE BEING FOLLOWED BY A VERY LARGE, TAME BEAR.
     142IF YOU WANT TO END YOUR ADVENTURE EARLY, SAY "QUIT".
     142TO SUSPEND YOUR ADVENTURE SUCH THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE LATER, SAY
     142"SUSPEND" (OR "PAUSE" OR "SAVE").  TO RE-START YOUR GAME AT A LATER
     142TIME, START UP A NEW ADVENTURE AND AFTER I SAY "YOU ARE STANDING...",
     142YOU MUST SAY "RESTORE".  YOU CAN'T SAY "RESTORE" AT ANY OTHER
     142TIME, HOWEVER.  YOU CAN ALSO NAME YOUR GAME BY SAVING "SUSPEND MINE"
     142(AND "RESTORE MINE", OF COURSE).
     142TO SEE WHAT HOURS THE CAVE IS NORMALLY OPEN, SAY "HOURS".
     142TO SEE HOW WELL YOU'RE DOING, SAY "SCORE".  TO GET FULL CREDIT FOR A
     142TREASURE, YOU MUST HAVE LEFT IT SAFELY IN THE BUILDING, THOUGH YOU GET
     142PARTIAL CREDIT JUST FOR LOCATING IT.  YOU LOSE POINTS FOR GETTING
     142KILLED, OR FOR QUITTING, THOUGH THE FORMER COSTS YOU MORE.  THERE ARE
     142ALSO POINTS BASED ON HOW MUCH (IF ANY) OF THE CAVE YOU'VE MANAGED TO
     142EXPLORE; IN PARTICULAR, THERE IS A LARGE BONUS JUST FOR GETTING IN (TO
     142DISTINGUISH THE BEGINNERS FROM THE REST OF THE PACK), AND THERE ARE
     142OTHER WAYS TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH SOME OF THE MORE
     142HARROWING SECTIONS.  IF YOU THINK YOU'VE FOUND ALL THE TREASURES, JUST
     142KEEP EXPLORING FOR A WHILE.  IF NOTHING INTERESTING HAPPENS, YOU
     142HAVEN'T FOUND THEM ALL YET.  IF SOMETHING INTERESTING *DOES* HAPPEN,
     142IT MEANS YOU'RE GETTING A BONUS AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GARNER MANY
     142MORE POINTS IN THE MASTER'S SECTION.  I MAY OCCASIONALLY OFFER HINTS
     142IF YOU SEEM TO BE HAVING TROUBLE.  IF I DO, I'LL WARN YOU IN ADVANCE
     142HOW MUCH IT WILL AFFECT YOUR SCORE TO ACCEPT THE HINTS.  FINALLY, TO
     142SAVE PAPER, YOU MAY SPECIFY "BRIEF", WHICH TELLS ME NEVER TO REPEAT
     142THE FULL DESCRIPTION OF A PLACE UNLESS YOU EXPLICITLY ASK ME TO.
     143DO YOU INDEED WISH TO QUIT NOW?
     144THERE IS NOTHING HERE WITH WHICH TO FILL THE VASE.
     145THE SUDDEN CHANGE IN TEMPERATURE HAS DELICATELY SHATTERED THE VASE.
     146IT IS BEYOND YOUR POWER TO DO THAT.
     147I DON'T KNOW HOW.
     148IT IS TOO FAR UP FOR YOU TO REACH.
     149YOU KILLED A LITTLE DWARF.  THE BODY VANISHES IN A CLOUD OF GREASY
     149BLACK SMOKE.
     150THE SHELL IS VERY STRONG AND IS IMPERVIOUS TO ATTACK.
     151WHAT'S THE MATTER, CAN'T YOU READ?  NOW YOU'D BEST START OVER.
     152THE AXE BOUNCES HARMLESSLY OFF THE DRAGON'S THICK SCALES.
     153THE DRAGON LOOKS RATHER NASTY.  YOU'D BEST NOT TRY TO GET BY.
     154THE LITTLE BIRD ATTACKS THE GREEN DRAGON, AND IN AN ASTOUNDING FLURRY
     154GETS BURNT TO A CINDER.  THE ASHES BLOW AWAY.
     155ON WHAT?
     156OKAY, FROM NOW ON I'LL ONLY DESCRIBE A PLACE IN FULL THE FIRST TIME
     156YOU COME TO IT.  TO GET THE FULL DESCRIPTION, SAY "LOOK".
     157TROLLS ARE CLOSE RELATIVES WITH THE ROCKS AND HAVE SKIN AS TOUGH AS
     157THAT OF A RHINOCEROS.  THE TROLL FENDS OFF YOUR BLOWS EFFORTLESSLY.
     158THE TROLL DEFTLY CATCHES THE AXE, EXAMINES IT CAREFULLY, AND TOSSES IT
     158BACK, DECLARING, "GOOD WORKMANSHIP, BUT IT'S NOT VALUABLE ENOUGH."
     159THE TROLL CATCHES YOUR TREASURE AND SCURRIES AWAY OUT OF SIGHT.
     160THE TROLL REFUSES TO LET YOU CROSS.
     161THERE IS NO LONGER ANY WAY ACROSS THE CHASM.
     162JUST AS YOU REACH THE OTHER SIDE, THE BRIDGE BUCKLES BENEATH THE
     162WEIGHT OF THE BEAR, WHICH WAS STILL FOLLOWING YOU AROUND.  YOU
     162SCRABBLE DESPERATELY FOR SUPPORT, BUT AS THE BRIDGE COLLAPSES YOU
     162STUMBLE BACK AND FALL INTO THE CHASM.
     163THE BEAR LUMBERS TOWARD THE TROLL, WHO LETS OUT A STARTLED SHRIEK AND
==p119==
   21MAR79     11:16:10    J./$TX8D              SYSTEMS REAL-TIME MONITOR-6.1     PAGE   29
     163SCURRIES AWAY.  THE BEAR SOON GIVES UP THE PURSUIT AND WANDERS BACK.
     164THE AXE MISSES AND LANDS NEAR THE BEAR WHERE YOU CAN'T GET AT IT.
     165WITH WHAT?  YOUR BARE HANDS?  AGAINST *HIS* BEAR HANDS??
     166THE BEAR IS CONFUSED; HE ONLY WANTS TO BE YOUR FRIEND.
     167FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, THE POOR THING IS ALREADY DEAD!
     168THE BEAR EAGERLY WOLFS DOWN YOUR FOOD, AFTER WHICH HE SEEMS TO CALM
     168DOWN CONSIDERABLY AND EVEN BECOMES RATHER FRIENDLY.
     169THE BEAR IS STILL CHAINED TO THE WALL.
     170THE CHAIN IS STILL LOCKED.
     171THE CHAIN IS NOW UNLOCKED.
     172THE CHAIN IS NOW LOCKED.
     173THERE IS NOTHING HERE TO WHICH THE CHAIN CAN BE LOCKED.
     174THERE IS NOTHING HERE TO EAT.
     175DO YOU WANT THE HINT?
     176DO YOU NEED HELP GETTING OUT OF THE MAZE?
     177YOU CAN MAKE THE PASSAGES LOOK LESS ALIKE BY DROPPING THINGS.
     178ARE YOU TRYING TO EXPLORE BEYOND THE PLOVER ROOM?
     179THERE IS A WAY TO EXPLORE THAT REGION WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT
     179FALLING INTO A PIT.  NONE OF THE OBJECTS AVAILABLE IS IMMEDIATELY
     179USEFUL IN DISCOVERING THE SECRET.
     180DO YOU NEED HELP GETTING OUT OF HERE?
     181DON'T GO WEST.
     182GLUTTONY IS NOT ONE OF THE TROLL'S VICES.  AVARICE, HOWEVER, IS.
     183YOUR LAMP IS GETTING DIM.  YOU'D BEST START WRAPPING THIS UP, UNLESS
     183YOU CAN FIND SOME FRESH BATTERIES.  I SEEM TO RECALL THERE'S A VENDING
     183MACHINE IN THE MAZE.  BRING SOME COINS WITH YOU.
     184YOUR LAMP HAS RUN OUT OF POWER.
     185THERE'S NOT MUCH POINT IN WANDERING AROUND OUT HERE, AND YOU CAN'T
     185EXPLORE THE CAVE WITHOUT A LAMP.  SO LET'S JUST CALL IT A DAY.
     186THERE ARE FAINT RUSTLING NOISES FROM THE DARKNESS BEHIND YOU.  AS YOU
     186TURN TOWARD THEM, THE BEAM OF YOUR LAMP FALLS ACROSS A BEARDED PIRATE.
     186HE IS CARRYING A LARGE CHEST.  "SHIVER ME TIMBERS!" HE CRIES, "I'VE
     186BEEN SPOTTED!  I'D BEST HIE MESELF OFF TO THE MAZE TO HIDE ME CHEST!"
     186WITH THAT, HE VANISHES INTO THE GLOOM.
     187YOUR LAMP IS GETTING DIM.  YOU'D BEST GO BACK FOR THOSE BATTERIES.
     188YOUR LAMP IS GETTING DIM.  I'M TAKING THE LIBERTY OF REPLACING THE
     188BATTERIES.
     189YOUR LAMP IS GETTING DIM, AND YOU'RE OUT OF SPARE BATTERIES.  YOU'D
     189BEST START WRAPPING THIS UP.
     190I'M AFRAID THE MAGAZINE IS WRITTEN IN DWARVISH.
     191"THIS IS NOT THE MAZE WHERE THE PIRATE LEAVES HIS TREASURE CHEST."
     192HMMM, THIS LOOKS LIKE A CLUE, WHICH MEANS IT'LL COST YOU 10 POINTS TO
     192READ IT.  SHOULD I GO AHEAD AND READ IT ANYWAY?
     193IT SAYS, "THERE IS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THIS PLACE, SUCH THAT ONE
     193OF THE WORDS I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN NOW HAS A NEW EFFECT."
     194IT SAYS THE SAME THING IT DID BEFORE.
     195I'M AFRAID I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
