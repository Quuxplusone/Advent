You're in a vast meadow that streaches endlessly in all directions.
To the west is a large tree.
Meadow

You're in the meadow, underneath a large oak tree.  There are small
carvings on the tree, and they seem to mean something.
Meadow near Tree

You're in a treehouse, barren of any furnishings except for a cubicle to
the south, which is filled with a shimmering green light.
Treehouse

You're in a cubicle.  A green glow surrounds you on all sides,
but it is impossible to see the source of it.
Green Cubicle

You are in a small, dark room with a passage to the north and a
set of ascending stone stairs to the east.
Small Room

You are in a twisting maze of little passages, all alike.
Maze

You are in a little maze of twisty passages, all alike.
Maze

You are in a twisty maze of little passages, all alike.
Maze

You are in a very dusty room with a teakwood floor.  You may leave this
room to the north and south.
Chest Room

You are in a very small room with oak walls, and it's a little cramped.
Inside Chest

You are in the Mystery Room, a very lovely room with exits to the
east, west, and south.  The hole in the ceiling is too far up to use.
Mystery Room

You have entered the Hall of the Sea, a room filled with blue-green
mists.  Mysterious shadows seem to dance upon the walls as your lamp
sheds light through the eerie colored fog.  Exits are east and west.
Hall of the Sea

You're in a damp, somewhat musty chamber that appears to be an
ancient catacomb.  There is a passage to the east.
Catacomb

You're in the Turkish Bath.  Soothing mist surrounds you.  You may
go down stone stairs to the west, or up a metal ramp to the east.
Turkish Bath

You have entered a small garden.  The soil is very loose here.  To the west
is a metal ramp that leads downward; to the north is a large glass building.
Garden

You're in an empty glass building that seems to have been used
as a greenhouse.  To the north is a house; to the south is a
garden; to the west is a store room.
Greenhouse


This is a very tiny store room that has a large hole in the floor
on the western side of the room, and an exit to the east.
Store Room

You're in the Hall of Tones.  Pleasant tunes can be heard as you
decide whether to go west, or up steep stairs to the east.
Hall of Tones

You are in a very beautiful room, the Chamber of Time.
Exits are to the east and west.
Chamber of Time

This room's walls are covered with a mixture of blood
and slimy ooze.  Exits: North and south.
Slime Room

You're in a library.  The only apparent exits to this room are:
a passage to the south and an archway to the east.
Library

You're in a kitchen.  There are two exits, one to the west and
one to the south.  The scent of food is in the air.
Kitchen

You are in the living room of the house.  Exits: North, south,
east, and a very narrow passage to the west.
Living Room

You are in a small foyer, barren of any furnishings, except for a large
glass cubicle to the south, which is filled with shimmering red light.
Exits: East and west, and a northern exit leading upstairs.
Foyer

You are in a glass cubicle.  Surrounding you is a shimmering
red glow, but it is impossible to see the source of it.
Red Cubicle

You're in a cool room with a towering waterfall filling up the eastern
part of the room.  You're on a path that bends north and west, and there's
a glass cubicle to the south, which is filled with shimmering blue light.
Waterfall

This room is only five feet high, and has exits to the south and east.
Mine Field

You are in a glass cubicle.  Surrounding you is a shimmering
blue glow, but it is impossible to see the source of it.
Blue Cubicle

You are at the northern end of a very long sewer pipe.  To the north
is a low room, and there are numerous holes in the floor of the pipe.
Sewer Pipe

This giant room is the home of the most valuable treasure in the cave.
In the direct center of the room, a sphere of great beauty was placed
many years ago.  The only exits to this room are the stairs above you.
Treasure Room

You're in a deep pit.  The only exit is straight up.
Viper Pit

You're in the front yard of the house.  To the west is a door, to the
south a dark hole, and meadow everywhere else.
Front Yard


You're in a meadow, north of a house.  For to the north,
a tiny oasis is visible.
North of House

You're in Burgerland!  A meadow surrounds this tiny oasis,
which has no apparent entrance.
Burgerland

You're in a hallway.  There are various openings to the north and west,
and two stairways: one leading up to the east and one down to the foyer.
Hallway

You're in the attic.  The only exit is a stairway leading downward.
Attic

You're in and old-fashioned bathroom, a very tidy place.
Exits are to the north and east.
Bathroom

You're in a large room, probably the master bedroom.  There is
an exit to the south, and one to the east.
Bedroom

You're in the sitting room.  Exits: west and south, and a cubicle to
the east, filled with shimmering purple light.
Sitting Room

You're in a cubicle.  A purple glow surrounds you, but you
cannot see the source of it.
Purple Cubicle

You're in a very tight east-west passageway.  There is also a small hole
in the floor on the northern side of the passage.  A freezing wind blows
out of the hole
East-West Passage

You're in an extremely cold room.  Icicles hang from the ceiling, and near
a particularly large icicle in the southern part of the room, is a hole.
Cold Room

You're on a sandy shore.  To the west is some more sand, but it seems
to be mixed with water.  There is a tight passage leading east.
Sandy Shore

You're in a pool of quicksand.  To the west you can see a path leading
outside, and to the east, a shore.
Quicksand

The floor here is quite rocky, making your footing quite unsure.  You're
on a path with a lighted passage to the south and a dark tunnel to the north.
Rocky Path

You're at the base of a mountain.  It is snowing lightly here,
partially covering an assortment of heavy wires.  To the north
is a cave leading underground.
Base of Mountain

You're in a room filled with cobwebs.  There appear to have been recent
archaeological diggings in this area.  Passages exit to the north and south.
Archaeology Room

You're in a small, but elaborately decorated chapel.  There is a large
machine in one corner of the room, and it is covered with dust.
The only exit to the room is an archway to the south.
Chapel


You're at the summit of Mount Frobozz.  The eastern slope is impassable,
but there are trails to the north and south.  An inviting, cozy lighted
shack is to the west.  It is snowing quite heavily here.
Summit of Mountain

You're at the top of the Expert Slope, a sheet of ice plunging downward
out of sight at an unpleasant angle.  A small snowy trail leads south.
Expert Trail

You are at the top of the Bunny Slope!  It seems as though a child would
have no problem skiing down, although walking down is out of the question.
A path leads away to the north.
Bunny Slope

You are in a comfortable ski shack, apparently a shelter from the cold
weather outside.  There's a rickety staircase leading downward in here.
Ski Shack

You're in a dark cave with a rocky floor.  There is a stairway leading
up and an eastern passage.
Cave

You're crawling over rocky cobbles is an east-west passage.  At the
eastern end is a formidable wooden door, which is open.
East-West Crawl

You're in a very peculiar room with no apparent exits.  There is an unusual
flashing light that fills the room, seemingly coming from far above.
Strobe Room

You are in a very long, north-south sewer pipe.  You can hear a strange,
distant, echoing sound, apparently an animal humming to himself.
Sewer Pipe

The carvings say:  ^^^ Morton's treehouse --- Six meters above ^^^


The note says:  'Thou who hast desecrated the Hallowed Tomb
               of Malak Fa'ar shall forever be plagued
               by His deadly curse!!'
At the bottom is scribbled the word:  ARGYLE

               Zarkas need a daily supply of water,
               and eat very little.  But when they
               are hungry, they are very picky.

               Most zarkas will eat only pizza, and
               this preference was probably estab-
               listed by the unusual climate in which
               they live.  Zarkas always enjoy a day
               outside, Which helps to make their
               reddish-purple fur shiny.  Because of
               their size, they can be found anywhere
               particularly near caves, usually in
               enclosed places.  They love precious
               metals.  Zarkas have a very unusual
               way of reproducing: they find anoth...
