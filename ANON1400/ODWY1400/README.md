## Adventure ]I[ (Unknown, 1979-ish)

_Adventure ]I[_ was written in BASIC by author (or perhaps authors)
unknown, somewhere connected with the public school system of
Fairfax County, Virginia. Two partial copies of the source code
have been discovered (by Rick Hammerstone and Alex Guma respectively),
showing that the game was under active development sometime between
1978–1979 and 1981–1982.

Here, in this directory, is a port of _Adventure ]I[_ written in C
by Arthur O'Dwyer, in October 2023. I based the code on Alex Guma's
reconstructed version.
