## Adventure ]I[ (Unknown, 1979-ish)

_Adventure ]I[_ was written in BASIC by author (or perhaps authors)
unknown, somewhere connected with the public school system of
Fairfax County, Virginia. Two partial copies of the source code
have been discovered, showing that the game was under active development
sometime between 1978–1979 and 1981–1982. Alex Guma provided the
earlier copy of "Adventure II" (code and data files); Rick Hammerstone
provided the later copy of "Adventure ]I[" (code files only).

Here, in this directory, is a port of _Adventure ]I[_ written in C
by Arthur O'Dwyer, in October 2023. I based the code almost entirely
on Alex Guma's reconstructed version (see this directory's
`GumaReconstruction` sibling).
