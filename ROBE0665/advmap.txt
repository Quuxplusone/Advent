  2	You are on a road at the top of a small hill, close to a large spire  
  2	of rock which rises nearly fifteen meters into the air here.  The
  2	spire looks natural, except for a tiny opening near its summit.  You  
  2	can see a small brick building at the end of the road to the east.    
  2	The road also continues westward for a short distance, but this  
  2	section of the roadway is clearly newly constructed and does not 
  2	appear to reach the bottom of the hill.  There is also a large

115	Several black rods with rusty stars on their ends are scattered

126	You are on the edge of a breath-taking view.  Far below you is an
126	active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging    
126	out, cascading back down into the depths.  The glowing rock fills the 
126	farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving every-  
126	thing an eerie, macabre appearance.  The air is filled with flickering
126	sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to   
126	the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other
126	sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted  
126	formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky  
126	light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep
126	gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to    
126	have been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire
126	crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the 
126	gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.  To   
126	the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously  
126	from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles 
126	ominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its 
126	own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the already  
126	hellish scene.  A dark, foreboding passage exits to the south.
