1       You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.
1       Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows out of the building and
1       down a gully to the south.  The road runs up a small hill to the west.
2       You are on a road at the top of a small hill, close to a large spire
2       of rock which rises nearly fifteen meters into the air here.  You
2       can see a small brick building at the end of the road to the east.
2       To the west, the roadway is blocked by a dense forest in which
2       the trees are too closely packed for you to make any headway.
2       The road, however, was presumably passable at one time, because
2       someone took the trouble to erect a large billboard here.
3       You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring.
3       Off to the north side is a small pantry.
4       You are in a valley in the forest beside a stream tumbling along a
4       rocky bed.  The stream is flowing to the south.
5       You are in open forest, with a deep valley to the east.
6       You are in a grassy meadow in a forest near both a valley and a road.
7       At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a two-inch slit
7       in the rock.  To the south, the streambed is bare rock.
8       You are in a 20-foot depression floored with bare dirt.  Set into the
8       dirt is a strong steel grate mounted in concrete.  A dry streambed
8       leads into the depression from the north.
9       You are in a small chamber beneath a 3x3 steel grate to the surface.
9       A low crawl over cobbles leads inward to the west.
10      You are crawling over cobbles in a low east/west passage.  There is
10      a dim light to the east.
11      You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the surface.
11      A low wide passage with cobbles becomes plugged with mud and debris
11      here, but an extremely narrow canyon leads upward and west.
11      Carved on the wall is the message: "Magic Word XYZZY".
12      You are in an awkward sloping east/west canyon.
13      You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet high.  The walls are frozen
13      rivers of orange stone.  A narrow canyon and a good passage exit
13      from east and west sides of the chamber.
14      At your feet is a small pit breathing traces of white mist.  An east
14      passage ends here except for a small crack leading on.  Rough stone
14      steps lead into the pit.
15      You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of sight to
15      the west.  The hall is filled with wisps of white mist swaying to
15      and fro almost as if alive.  There are passages to the north and
15      south, and a stone stairway leads upward.
16      The crack is far too small for you to follow.
17      You are on the east bank of a fissure slicing clear across the hall.
17      The mist is quite thick here, and the fissure is too wide to jump.
18      This is a low room with a crude note on the wall.  The note says,
18      "You won't get it up the steps".
19      You are in the Hall of the Mountain King, with passages off in
19      most directions, some of which appear to be newly constructed.
20      You're a little bruised, but you made it.
21      You didn't make it.
22      You are walking along a sloping north/south path which joins
22      a steeply descending northwest passage.  There is a small stream
22      beside the path, and you hear the sound of cascading water ahead.
23      You are at the west end of the Twopit Room.  There is a large hole in
23      the wall above the pit at this end of the room.
24      You are at the bottom of the eastern pit in the Twopit Room.  There is
24      a small pool of oil in one corner of the pit.
25      You are at the bottom of the western pit in the Twopit Room.  There is
25      a large hole in the wall about 25 feet above you.
26      You clamber up the plant and scurry through the hole at the top.
27      You are on the west side of the fissure in the Hall of Mists.
28      You are in a low N/S passage at a hole in the floor.  The hole goes
28      down to an E/W passage.
29      You are in the East Side Chamber of the Hall of the Mountain King.
29      There is a safe mounted in the wall here.
30      You are in the West Side Chamber of the Hall of the Mountain King.
30      A passage continues west and up here.
31      >$<
32      You can't get by the snake.
33      You are in a large room, with a passage to the south, a passage to the
33      west, and a wall of broken rock to the east.  There is a large "Y2" on
33      a rock in the room's center.
34      You are in a jumble of rock, with an exit to the west and a narrow
34      crack to the northwest.  There is also a two-inch slit in the floor.
35      You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of
35      sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below.  Traces of
35      white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the left.
35      Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that
35      someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and
35      25 feet away there is a similar window in the wall of the pit.
36      You are in a dirty broken passage.  To the east is a crawl.  To the
36      west is a large passage.  Above you is a hole to another passage.
37      You are on the brink of a small clean climbable pit.  A crawl leads
37      west.
38      You are in the bottom of a small pit with a little stream, which
38      enters and exits through tiny slits.
39      You are in a large room full of dusty rocks.  There is a big hole in
39      the floor, and a passage leading east.  There is dust everywhere.
40      You have crawled through a very low wide passage parallel to and north
40      of the Hall of Mists.
41      You are at the west end of Hall of Mists.  A low wide crawl continues
41      west and another goes north.  To the south is a little passage 6 feet
41      off the floor.
42      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
43      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.

56      Dead end.
57      You are on the brink of a thirty foot pit with a massive orange column
57      down one wall.  You could climb down here but you could not get back
57      up.  The maze continues at this level.
58      Dead end.
59      You have crawled through a very low wide passage parallel to and north
59      of the Hall of Mists.
60      You are at the east end of a very long hall apparently without side
60      chambers.  In the south wall are several wide cracks and a high
60      hole, but the hole is far above your head.  To the east a wide
60      crawl slants up.  To the north a small circular passage slants down.
61      You are at the west end of a very long featureless hall.  The hall
61      joins up with a narrow north/south passage.
62      You are at a crossover of a high N/S passage and a low E/W one.
63      Dead end.
64      You are at a complex junction.  A low hands and knees passage from the
64      north joins a higher crawl from the east to make a walking passage
64      going west.  There is also a large room above.  The air is damp here.
65      You are in Bedquilt, a long east/west passage with holes everywhere.
65      To explore at random select north, south, southwest, up, or down.
66      You are in a room whose walls resemble swiss cheese.  Obvious passages
66      go west, east, south, NE, and NW.  Part of the room is occupied by a
66      large bedrock block.
67      You are at the east end of the Twopit Room.  The floor here is
67      littered with thin rock slabs, which make it easy to descend the pits.
67      There is a path here bypassing the pits to connect passages from east
67      and west.  There are holes all over, but the only big one is on the
67      wall directly over the west pit where you can't get to it.
68      You are in a large low circular chamber whose floor is an immense slab
68      fallen from the ceiling (Slab Room).  East and west there once were
68      large passages, but they are now filled with boulders.  Low small
68      passages go north and south, and the south one quickly bends west
68      around the boulders.
69      You are in a secret N/S canyon above a large room.
70      You are in a secret N/S canyon above a sizable passage.
71      You are in a secret canyon at a junction of three canyons, bearing
71      north, south, and SE.  The north one is as tall as the other two
71      combined.
72      You are in a large low room.  Crawls lead north, NE, and SW.
73      Dead end crawl.
74      You are in a secret canyon which here runs E/W.  It crosses over a
74      very tight canyon 15 feet below.  If you go down you may not be able
74      to get back up.
75      The canyon becomes too tight to proceed.  Your only exit is west.
76      ** Unused **
77      You are in a tall E/W canyon.  A low tight crawl goes 3 feet north and
77      seems to open up.
78      The canyon runs into a mass of boulders -- dead end.
79      The stream flows out through a pair of 1 foot diameter sewer pipes.
79      It would be advisable to use the exit.
80      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.

86      Dead end.
87      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
88      You are in a long, narrow corridor stretching out of sight to the
88      west.  At the eastern end is a hole through which you can see a
88      profusion of leaves.
89      There is nothing here to climb.  Use "up" or "out" to leave the pit.
90      You have climbed up the plant and out of the pit.
91      You are at the top of a steep incline above a large room.  You could
91      climb down here, but you would not be able to climb up.  There is a
91      passage leading back to the north.
92      You are in the Giant Room.  The ceiling here is too high up for your
92      lamp to show it.  Cavernous passages lead east, north, and south.  On
92      the west wall is scrawled the inscription, "FEE FIE FOE FOO" [sic].
93      The passage here is blocked by a recent cave-in.
94      You are at one end of an immense north/south passage.
95      You are in a magnificent cavern with a rushing stream, which cascades
95      over a sparkling waterfall into a roaring whirlpool which disappears
95      through a hole in the floor.  Passages exit to the south and west.
96      You are in the Soft Room.  The walls are covered with heavy curtains,
96      the floor with a thick pile carpet.  Moss covers the ceiling.  High
96      in the wall, there is an eight-inch square hole, but it is too high
96      for you to reach or see into.
97      This is the Oriental Room.  Ancient oriental cave drawings cover the
97      walls.  A gently sloping passage leads upward to the north, another
97      passage leads SE, and a hands and knees crawl leads east.
98      You are following a wide path around the outer edge of a large cavern.
98      Far below, through a heavy white mist, strange splashing noises can be
98      heard.  The mist rises up through a fissure in the ceiling.  The path
98      hugs the cavern's rim to the NE and south, while another branch forks
98      SE.  A round chute with extremely smooth walls angles sharply up
98      to the southwest.
99      You are in an alcove.  A small NW path seems to widen after a short
99      distance.  An extremely tight tunnel leads east.  It looks like a very
99      tight squeeze.  An eerie light can be seen at the other end.
100     You're in a small chamber lit by an eerie green light.  The walls and
100     ceiling are covered with tiny cracks.  A narrow tunnel exits to the
100     west, and a dark corridor leads north.  There is a hole (eight inches
100     on a side) carved into the wall, which leads to a downward shaft.
101     You're in the Dark-Room.  A corridor leading south is the only exit.
102     You are in an arched hall.  A coral passage once continued up and east
102     from here, but is now blocked by debris.  The air smells of sea water.
103     You're in a large room carved out of sedimentary rock.  The floor and
103     walls are littered with bits of shells imbedded in the stone.  A
103     shallow passage proceeds downward, and a somewhat steeper one leads
103     up.  A low hands and knees passage enters from the south.
104     You are in a long sloping corridor with ragged sharp walls.
105     You are in a cul-de-sac about eight feet across.
106     You are in an anteroom leading to a large passage to the east.  Small
106     passages go south, west and up.  The remnants of recent digging are
106     evident.  A sign in midair reads
106     -        +--------------------------------------------+        -
106     -        ! Cave under construction beyond this point. !        -

107     You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all different.
108     You are at Witt's End.  Passages lead off in *ALL* directions.
109     You are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across.  The floor is
109     covered by white mist seeping in from the north.  The walls extend
109     upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspended from some unseen point far
109     above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and
109     midway between the canyon walls.  A small window can be seen in
109     either wall, some fifty feet up.  The canyon continues north and
109     south, and a dark passage leads west.
110     You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of
110     sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below.  Traces of
110     white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the left.
110     Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that
110     someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and
110     25 feet away there is a similar window in the wall of the pit.
111     You are at the southern end of a north/south passage at a large hole
111     in the floor.  A large stalactite extends from the roof and almost
111     reaches the bottom of the passage below.  You could climb down it,
111     and jump from it to the floor, but having done so you would be
111     unable to reach it to climb back up.
112     You are in a little maze of twisting passages, all different.
113     You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir.  An opaque cloud
113     of white mist fills the room and rises rapidly upward.  The lake is
113     fed by a stream, which tumbles out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet
113     overhead and splashes noisily into the water somewhere within the
113     mist.  The indistinct shape of the opposite shore can be dimly seen
113     through the mist.  The only passage goes back toward the south.
114     Dead end.
115     You are at the northeast end of an immense room, even larger than
115     the Giant Room.  It appears to be a repository for the
115     "ADVENTURE" program.  Massive torches far overhead bathe the room
115     with smoky yellow light.  Just below them, some fifteen feet up,
115     is a large hole in the wall, but you could not climb to it.
115     Several black rods with rusty stars on their ends are scattered
115     about the room.  Off to one side, a great many dwarves are
115     sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly.  A sign nearby reads: "Do
115     not disturb the dwarves!"  An immense mirror is hanging against
115     one wall, and stretches to the other end of the room, where
115     various other sundry objects can be glimpsed dimly in the
115     distance.  An unoccupied telephone booth stands against the north
115     wall.  Much of the floor is covered with a thin layer of dust
115     which seems to be thicker just underneath a large hole in the
115     ceiling at the far end of the room.
116     You are at the southwest end of the repository.  To one side is a
116     small depression filled with fierce green snakes.  On the other
116     side is a row of small wicker cages, each of which contains a
116     seemingly restless little bird.  A large number of velvet pillows are
116     scattered about on the floor.  To the north, there is a climbable
116     pit above which (maybe twenty feet up) is a large hole into a
116     dark chamber.  A vast mirror stretches off to the northeast,
116     almost reaching the phone booth.  Mounted very low in the south
116     wall is a large steel grate, securely locked.  The floor is covered
116     with a thin layer of dust which may have fallen from the hole
116     above you.
117     You are on one side of a large, deep chasm.  A heavy white mist rising
117     up from below obscures all view of the far side.  A SW path leads away
117     from the chasm into a winding corridor.
118     You are in a long winding corridor sloping out of sight in both
118     directions.
119     You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
120     You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
121     You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
122     You are on the northeast side of a deep chasm.  A NE path leads away
122     from the chasm on this side.
123     You're in a long east/west corridor.  A faint rumbling noise can be
123     heard in the distance.
124     The path forks here.  The left fork leads northeast.  A dull rumbling
124     seems to get louder in that direction.  The right fork leads southeast
124     down a gentle slope.  The main corridor enters from the west.
125     The walls are quite warm here.  From the north can be heard a steady
125     roar, so loud that the entire cave seems to be trembling.  Another
125     passage leads south, and a low crawl goes east.
126     You are on the edge of a breath-taking view.  Far below you is an
126     active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging
126     out, cascading back down into the depths.  The glowing rock fills the
126     farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving every-
126     thing an eerie, macabre appearance.  The air is filled with flickering
126     sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to
126     the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other
126     sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted
126     formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky
126     light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep
126     gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to
126     have been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire
126     crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the
126     gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.  To
126     the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously
126     from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles
126     ominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its
126     own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the already
126     hellish scene.  A dark, foreboding passage exits to the south.
127     You are in a small chamber filled with large boulders.  The walls are
127     very warm, causing the air in the room to be almost stifling from the
127     heat.  The only exit is a crawl heading west, through which is coming
127     a low rumbling.
128     You are walking along a gently sloping north/south passage lined with
128     oddly shaped limestone formations.
129     You are standing at the entrance to a large, barren room.  A sign
129     posted above the entrance reads:  "Caution!  Bear in room!"
129     A passage leads to the north behind you.
130     You are inside a barren room.  The center of the room is completely
130     empty except for some dust.  Marks in the dust lead away toward the
130     far end of the room.  The only exit is the way you came in.
131     You are in a maze of twisting little passages, all different.
132     You are in a little maze of twisty passages, all different.
133     You are in a twisting maze of little passages, all different.
134     You are in a twisting little maze of passages, all different.
135     You are in a twisty little maze of passages, all different.
136     You are in a twisty maze of little passages, all different.
137     You are in a little twisty maze of passages, all different.
138     You are in a maze of little twisting passages, all different.
139     You are in a maze of little twisty passages, all different.
140     Dead end.
141     You are on a narrow promontory at the foot of a waterfall, which
141     spurts from an overhead hole in the rock wall and splashes into a
141     large reservoir, sending up clouds of mist and spray.
141     Through the thick white mist looms a polished marble slab, to
141     which is affixed an enormous rusty iron anvil.  In golden letters
141     are written the words: "Whoso Pulleth Out This Sword of This
141     Stone and Anvil, is Rightwise King-Born of All This Mountain."
141     There is a narrow chimney on the east side of the promontory,
141     and a small path runs north beside the waterfall.
142     You are on a narrow shelf above and east of the top of a very steep
142     chimney.  A long smooth granite slide curves down out of sight
142     to the east.  If you go down the slide, you may not be able to
142     climb back up.
143     You are in the throne room of the Mountain King, with a western exit.
144     You are in a small alcove behind the throne room.  There are no
144     exits from this room.
145     You are dragged down, down, into the depths of the whirlpool.
145     Just as you can no longer hold your breath, you are shot out over
145     a waterfall into the shallow end of a large reservoir.  Gasping
145     and sputtering, you crawl weakly towards the shore....
146     You are in a small clearing in the midst of a dense forest, next
146     to a stone spire with a wooden doorway.  An overgrown roadway runs
146     near here.  The trees make progress impossible to the east, but
146     seem to thin out a bit towards the west and north.
147     You are at the high point of a wide grassy knoll, partially surrounded
147     by dense forest.  The land rises to the south and east, and drops off
147     sharply to the north and west.  The air smells of sea water.
148     You are at the edge of a trackless salt marsh.  Tall reeds obscure
148     the view except to the south where you can see a grassy knoll.
149     You're in a trackless salt marsh.
150     You're in a trackless salt marsh.
151     You're in a trackless salt marsh.
152     You're in a trackless salt marsh.
153     You're on a sandy beach at the edge of the open sea.  The beach
153     stretches out of sight to the south.  To the north, the beach ends
153     in cliffs and broken rocks.
154     You are at a jumble of large broken rocks.  A gentle path leads up
154     to the top of the nearby cliffs.  A narrow treacherous path
154     disappears among the rocks at the foot of the cliff.
155     You are on a high cliff overlooking the sea.  Far below the
155     rolling breakers smash into a jumble of large broken rocks.
155     The thunder of the surf is deafening.
156     You're at the bottom of the cliff, smashed to smithereens by the
156     pounding surf.
157     You are at Thunder Hole, a funnel shaped cavern opening onto the sea.
157     The noise of the surf pounding against the outer rocks of the cave is
157     amplified by the peculiar shape of the cave, causing a thunder-like
157     booming sound to reverberate throughout the cave.  Outside, a narrow
157     path leads south towards some large rocks.
158     You are in a gigantic room at the top of a wide arched staircase.
158     On the east side, there is a tiny door no more than six inches high.
158     Above it, far out of reach, is a overhanging shelf.
159     You are in a low cramped chamber at the back of a small cave.
159     There is a shelf in the rock wall at about the height of your
159     shoulder.
160     You are on a wide ledge, bounded on one side by a rock wall,
160     and on the other by a sheer cliff.  The only way past is through
160     a large wrought-iron door.
161     You feel dizzy...Everything around you is spinning, expanding,
161     growing larger....  Dear me!  Is the cave bigger or are you smaller?
162     You are again overcome by a sickening vertigo, but this time
162     everything around you is shrinking...Shrinking...
163     You are again overcome by a sickening vertigo, but this time
163     everything is shrinking... I mean, you are growing.  This is
163     terribly confusing.
164     You feel dizzy...Everything around you is spinning, expanding,
164     growing larger....
165     You're at the bottom of the cliff with a broken neck.
166     You are at the western tip of the Blue Grotto.  A large lake almost
166     covers the cavern floor, except for where you are standing.  Small
166     holes high in the rock wall to the east admit a dim light.  The
166     reflection of the light from the water suffuses the cavern with
166     a hazy bluish glow.
167     You are on the shore of an underground sea.  A high wooden
167     structure of vast proportions extends out into the water to the
167     east.  The way west is through a wrought-iron door.
168     You are on the eastern shore of the Blue Grotto.  An ascending
168     tunnel disappears into the darkness to the east.
169     You are at a high rock on the NE side of a watery chamber at the mouth
169     of a small brook.  An unknown gas bubbles up through the water from
169     the chamber floor.  A bluish light can be seen to the southwest.
170     You are in a long tunnel running from east to west.  A wind is
170     blowing up the tunnel from the water below, giving rise to an
170     eerie sound as it passes over the small cracks in the wall.
171     When the syllable fades from your lips, you have a fleeting
171     sensation that you are shrinking into nothingness.  The feeling
171     leaves you dizzy and you stumble over.  Unfortunately, before any
171     sprites can rescue you, you feel yourself slipping into a torrent
171     of water and being dragged down into a yawning chasm (formerly a
171     two-inch slit).
172     You are in a very tight N/S crack.  The passage seems to widen to
172     the south.
173     You are in a very tight N/S crack.  The passage south is blocked
173     by a recent cave-in.
174     You're in the Cloakroom.  This is where the dreaded Wumpus repairs
174     to sleep off heavy meals.  (Adventurers are his favorite dinner!)
174     Two very narrow passages exit NW and NE.
175     You are in a rough passage with exits to the east and north.
176     You are in a pit of enormous proportions and you can just barely
176     see the top of the wall far out of reach above you.  In front of
176     you are large bars of iron through which you could easily pass,
176     but below which there is a precipitous drop into nothingness.
177     You are at the north end of a narrow passage near a hole in the floor.
178     The NE passage is blocked by a recent cave-in.
179     You are in a sloping muddy defile, next to a tumbling brook.
180     You are in a level E/W passage partially blocked by an overhanging
180     tongue of rock.  A steep scramble would take you up over the tongue,
180     whence continues an upward crawl.
181     The dog won't let you pass.
182     You're at the end of a long level hall which runs to the east.
182     A steep crawl descends from here as well.
183     You are in a star-shaped chamber.  Passages exit north, east, west,
183     SE and SW.
184     You are in a winding E/W passage.
185     As you utter the magic word, you immediately become disoriented
185     and you feel like your body is twisting and turning in a variety
185     of directions.  The sensation lasts for a few moments, and you
185     quickly return to normal.
186     You're at the intersection of two long tunnels.  One goes NW,
186     the other NE.
187     You're in a long narrow N/S passage which begins to twist and turn
187     toward its northern end.
188     You're in the Rotunda.  Corridors radiate to the southwest, east and
188     west.  There is a telephone booth standing against the north wall.
189     You are standing in a telephone booth at the side of a large chamber.
189     Hung on the wall is a banged-up pay telephone of ancient design.
190     You're at the Devil's Chair, a large crystallization shaped like a
190     seat, at the edge of a black abyss.  You can't see the bottom.
190     An upward path leads away from the abyss.
191     You're in a dead-end crack.
192     You're on a small gravel beach at the south wall of the Blue Grotto.
192     A gravelly path leads southeast.
193     You are in the Flower Room.  The walls are covered with colorful,
193     intricate, flower-like patterns of crystallized gypsum.
194     You are at the end of a short E/W corridor.
195     You are looking west from the end of a short E/W corridor.  At your
195     feet is a pile of loose rubble.  On your left is a hole into another
195     chamber.
196     You are in an arched hall.  The remnants of a now-plugged coral
196     passage lie to the east.  The north wall has partially crumbled,
196     exposing a large connecting hole to another room.
197     You're in the Vestibule, a short passageway between two rooms to the
197     east and north.  There is also a sandy path leading down to the west.
198     You are in the Fairy Grotto.  All around you innumerable stalactites,
198     arranged in immense colonnades, form elegant arches.  On every side
198     you hear the dripping of water, like the footsteps of a thousand
198     fairies.  A small stream runs from the SW corner.  A bright glow
198     emanates from the south side of the grotto, and a steep passage
198     descends to the east.
199     You have approached the lower end of a steep passage, but it is
199     just too cold here to hang around, and you aren't properly equipped
199     to continue.  With teeth chattering, you climb back up....
200     You are in the Crystal Palace.  An overhead vein of phosphorescent
200     quartz casts a luminous glow which is reflected by countless chips of
200     mica embedded in both walls, which consist of some sort of highly
200     reflective glass, apparently of volcanic origin.  A winding path
200     of yellow sandstone leads east and another passage exits north.
201     You are following a yellow sandstone path which runs from east to
201     west here and joins with a rocky path leading north.  There is a
201     bright glow to the west.
202     You are in a very tall chamber whose walls are comprised of many
202     different rock strata.  Layers of red and yellow sandstone
202     intertwine with bright bands of calcareous limestone in a rainbow-
202     like profusion of color.  The rainbow effect is so real, you
202     are almost tempted to look for a pot of gold!  Poised far over
202     your head, a gigantic slab, wedged tightly between the north and
202     south walls, forms a natural bridge across the roof of the chamber.
202     There are exits on the east and west.
203     You're in a steeply sloping passage.  It is very cold here.
204     You are in the Hall of Ice, in the deepest part of the caverns.
204     During winter, frigid outside air settles here, making this room
204     extremely cold all year round.  The walls and ceilings are covered
204     with a thick coating of ice.  An upward passage exits to the west.
205     You are standing near the edge of a slab far above the floor of a
205     circular chamber whose walls are a rainbow of multi-colored rock.
205     There is a small stairway leading down to the west.
206     You are in a low, wide room below another chamber.  A small green
206     pond fills the center of the room.  The lake is apparently spring-
206     fed.  A large passage continues west.
207     You are in a small cavern behind a waterfall which tumbles down
207     before you.  A narrow path leads westward skirting the edge of
207     the falls and a mist-filled chimney climbs steeply to the east.
208     You are in a tall canyon on the south side of a raging river
208     which enters from the east over a cascading waterfall that covers
208     much of the area with a fine mist.  Written in the mud in crude
208     letters are the words: "You Have Found Lost River."  A wide path
208     leads west along the bank.  The pathway narrows to the east where
208     it seems to disappear into the waterfall.
209     You are standing on a large flat rock table at the western end of
209     Lost River Canyon.  Beneath your feet, the river disappears amidst
209     foam and spray into a large sinkhole.  A gentle path leads east
209     along the river's south shore.
210     As you sit in Devil's Chair, the rock seat quickly tips into the
210     formation and you find yourself sliding down a smoothly carved
210     chute which winds its way down through the rock.  After a few
210     moments, your slide ends abruptly as you exit into empty space
210     and fall (slightly bruised, but otherwise unhurt) to the floor
210     of a chamber below.
211     The staircase is now unclimbable.
212     You are standing in a telephone booth at the side of the Repository.
213     You're at the east end of a level passage at a hole in the floor.
214     You're at the north edge of a dark cove.  There is a passage to
214     the northeast.
215     You are in a dry granite basin, worn smooth eons ago by water
215     swirling down from a now-dry spillway.  The basin runs from
215     northeast to southwest here.
216     You're in a dry spillway east of and above a smooth rock basin.
217     You are in the Winery, a cool dark room which extends some
217     distance off to the east.  A spillway exits down and to the west.
218     You are to the east of the Winery, where the room ends in a thicket
218     of high, sharp, pointed, climable limestone pinnacles.  There is a
218     narrow ledge just above the top of the spires.
219     You are at the southern end of a high-vaulted cavern whose roof
219     rises over fifty meters to culminate in a series of pointed
219     arches directly over your head.  There are also two low arches to
219     either side, forming side portals which give the entire area the
219     feel of a Gothic cathedral.  Behind you, there is a hole in the
219     wall about fifteen feet above your head but the wall is much too
219     smooth for you to climb.
220     You're at the east portal of the Gothic Cathedral.
221     You're at the west portal of the Gothic Cathedral.
222     You are at the foot of the Altar, an immense, broad stalagmite.
222     The room opens behind you to the south.
223     You're on top of an enormous, broad stalagmite.  There is a hole
223     in the ceiling overhead.
224     You are in a room the size and shape of a small crypt.  A narrow
224     cut exits east.  There is a hole in the floor.
225     You are in the Gothic Chapel, a small chamber adjoining the Gothic
225     Cathedral.
226     You are on the floor of the Rainbow Room.  In fact, you are spread
226     *ALL OVER* the floor of the Rainbow Room.
227     You are in a dimly lit passage behind Thunder Hole.  Etched into
227     the rock wall are the ominous words:
227     *       "You are approaching the River Styx.       *
227     *        Lasciate Ogni Speranza Voi Ch'Entrate."   *
228     You are at the River Styx, a narrow little stream cutting directly
228     across the passageway.  The edge of the stream is littered with sticks
228     and other debris washed in by a recent rainfall.  On the far side
228     of the river, the passage continues east.
229     You're on the east side of the river.  There is a very wide stairway
229     here leading up to a large room.
230     You are on a ledge at the northern end of a long N/S crawl.  The
230     ledge is above a large number of sharp vertical limestone spires.
230     An attempt to climb down could be dangerous, particularly if you're
230     carrying anything large or unwieldy.
231     The oaken cask shifts position as you climb down, and you find
231     yourself neatly skewered on the point of a limestone spire.
232     You have poled your boat across the calm water.
233     You have poled your boat across the dark water.
234     You have poled your boat across the Blue Grotto.
235     You're at Dante's Rest, on the north side of a yawning dark chasm.
235     A passage continues west along the chasm's edge.
236     As you click the heels of the ruby slippers, the world around you
236     is transformed into a swirling mist and you get the sensation that
236     you are moving at great speed -- so great, in fact, that your
236     possessions are stripped away by the sudden rush of wind.  Soon,
236     however, your speed decreases and the mist begins to clear.
237     As you click the heels of the ruby slippers, the world around you
237     is transformed into a swirling mist and you get the sensation that
237     you are moving at great speed -- so great, in fact, that your
237     possessions are stripped away by the sudden rush of wind.  This
237     time, the wind is so strong that you feel even the slippers fall
237     from your feet into the void.  In the distance, you hear a voice
237     saying, "There's no place like home."  The mist clears swiftly,
237     and you find yourself back in familiar territory.
238     You're in the caretaker's pantry.
239     You are in a small tunnel which has been dug through the rainbow
239     colored strata.  The only exit is a stairway leading up.
240     As you crawl around in the tunnels, you hear a rumbling noise and
240     you notice that the cavern roof is beginning to give way.  You
240     quickly try to make your escape, but you can't make it out in
240     time and are buried in the landslide.
241     You are standing on a large mountain with steep cliffs leading
241     down on all sides.  On the far side of the cliffs you can see
241     in the distance several fierce-looking animals of gigantic size.
241     You're only safe path of escape leads through several giant
241     columns of iron to the south.
242     You are on the far side of the massive iron columns.  There
242     is a reddish glow to the south, but the path is blocked by
242     a wide fissure which is much too large to cross.  The cave seems
242     very warm here.
243     You are standing at the south side of a locked grate which
243     leads into the repository to the north.  There is a passage
243     south which leads slightly downward toward an area lit by
243     a dull reddish glow.  The floor of the passage is broken by
243     some small fissures which you can easily step across.  The
243     walls of the cave here are quite warm and you can feel an
243     intense heat radiating from the southern corridor.
244     A few steps ahead of you, the passage has been blocked by
244     a flow of molten lava which has melted its way into the
244     chamber.  It is almost too hot to breathe here.
245     You are at the bottom of a small, climbable pit.
246     You are about midway along a beanstalk which grows through a
246     hole in the ceiling directly above you.  The entire room is
246     bathed in light from torches hanging on the wall at this level.
247     You are in a large room which seems to have been recently
247     carved out of solid rock.  There is a beanstalk here growing
247     up out of a hole in the floor.  There is also a small
247     passage to the east.  A sign floating in midair reads:
247     "DANGER -- BLASTING AREA!  Proceed at your own risk.
247     [Witt Construction Company]"  There is a faint smell of gas
247     which appears to grow stronger near the eastern corridor.
248     You are in a small cavern which is clearly the result of recent
248     excavation work.  There is a small tunnel leading west.
249     Just as you reach the far end of the passage, there is a
249     tremendous explosion which drops several tons of rock in the
249     chamber, crushing you completely in the process.
250     You are in a swirling grey fog.  Moist tendrils caress your skin
250     which seem to draw all warmth from your body.  There is no sound.
251     You have entered into a cavern so vast that its far end is invisible.
251     Before you there is a deep and narrow channel, empty and silent
251     with hardly a trickle of water flowing among the brown and
251     red-stained stones of its bed; but on the near side there is
251     a path, much broken and decayed, that winds its way eastward among
251     the ruined walls and paving-stones of an ancient dwarf highroad.
251     In the other direction, the road turns to the southwest and quickly
251     disappears into a dense fog.
252     As you click the heels of the ruby slippers, the world around you
252     is transformed into a swirling mist and you get the sensation that
252     you are moving at great speed.  Unfortunately, your flight is cut
252     short by the wumpus who seems able to navigate even more effectively
252     in the misty world.  With a strength beyond defense, the wumpus grabs
252     you by the neck.  Your life passes before you as the wumpus hungrily
252     eyes its captive.
253     Before you is a low cliff, some five fathoms high, with a
253     broken and jagged top.  Over it water trickles down a wide
253     cleft.  To the north there is a flight of stairs cut in the rock.
253     The main road runs both east and west from here.
254     A dark still lake stretches before you.  Not even your lantern
254     is reflected in its sullen surface.  Beyond the ominous water
254     are reared vast cliffs.  There is a descending staircase to the
254     west which joins a path that goes northward around the eastern
254     edge of the lake.
255     The path ends in jumble of boulders.
256     The water looks very unpleasant, and I can't swim.
257     You are on a stony ridge overlooking the southern end of a dark
257     lake.  A road meanders away to the south.  Below you, between the
257     water's edge and the looming cliffs, there is a small sandy beach.
258     You are on a beach by a solid stone cliff.  You can make out the
258     edge of a dark body of water a short distance to the north.
259     You are at the foot of a huge stairway that runs into a seemingly
259     solid granite wall.  The stairs climb eastwards into darkness.
260     You have reached an arched passage with a level floor leading
260     eastward and stairs descending westward.  There is also a path
260     to the south.
261     You are in a descending E/W passage.  The air is hot and
261     stifling, although a current of cooler air can be felt issuing
261     from some invisible openings on your right and left.
262     You're in an E/W passage crossed with fissures and chasms.
262     A seven foot crack blocks the passage to the east.  Beyond
262     the crack the passage winds on into the dark.  The passage
262     is still descending to the east here, so that the other ledge
262     is perhaps three feet below this one.
263     To the west the passage is split by a seven foot crack, and you
263     can see the far edge above you.  To the east there is darkness.
264     How am I expected to deal with that seven foot crack?!
265     To the east stands a wide dark arch opening into three
265     passages.  All lead eastwards; but the left-handed passage
265     plunges down, while the right-hand climbs up, and the middle
265     way seems to run on, smooth and level but very narrow.
265     To the north of the great arch stands a stone door, half open.
265     To the west the passage fades into darkness.
266     You're in a wide chamber.  In the middle of the floor there is
266     a large round hole which you might be able to climb down.
266     There is a south door.
267     You're clinging to the side of a dry well.  The bottom (if any)
267     is lost in darkness.
268     You're at the bottom of the dry well.  A well-used path leads north.
268     There is also a path leading into a canyon on the west.
269     You're on a well-used N/S path.
270     You're at the bottom of a spiral stone staircase.  A path leads
270     south, and there is a wooden doorway to the west.
271     You're on a spiral stone staircase.
272     You're in a little chamber with a small four-inch square window 
272     open to the out-of-doors.
273     You're in a gradually climbing E/W passage.
274     You're in a huge hall; its black walls, polished and smooth as
274     glass, flash and glitter.  There are exits to the west, east,
274     and north.  A faint light can be seen from the north passage.
275     You are in a wide N/S corridor.  A glimmer of light comes from
275     a doorway to the east.
276     You're in a large square chamber, which is lit by a wide shaft
276     high in the far wall.  The light falls directly on a table in
276     the middle of the room, a single oblong block of stone.  Unlike
276     most of the chambers in this cavern, this one seems to be largely
276     free of dust.  A wide corridor exits to the west, a smaller passage
276     to the east.  There is also a doorway into a small room to the south.
277     You're on a steeply descending E/W flight of stairs.
278     You're on a narrow E/W path that slopes down swiftly.  The air is
278     hot.  Red light flickers from an archway ahead.
279     You're at the east end of a cavernous hall.  Across the floor,
279     close to the feet of two huge pillars, there is a great fissure.
279     Flames lick at its brink, casting weird shadows in the
279     northern and southern reaches of the hall.
280     You're at the south end of the cavernous hall.  The fiery fissure 
280     is to the east of you.
281     You're before a black chasm.  To the north a slender bridge of stone,
281     without a railing, spans the chasm.
282     You're teetering dangerously out on the middle of the stone arch.
283     You are next to a black chasm, spanned by a slender bridge of
283     stone.  Great stairs lead northwards.
284     You are in a round room which seems to be made entirely from
284     colored marbles which reflect light every which way.  Stairs exit
284     downward to the south.
285     You are at the bottom of the chasm.  An arched passage, inches deep
285     in dust, leads west.  Another passage goes south.
286     You are in a small chamber of black rock.  A passage leads north.
287     You are in a large room lit by seven torches.  Seven stone chairs are
287     against the wall.  Passages enter from the east, west and south.
288     You are in a small chamber adjoining the torch room.  A huge fireplace
288     takes up one wall.
289     You clamber up the chimney to find...
290     A nice jump!  Congratulations!  Lucky it wasn't uphill.
291     Your jump is not quite far enough to take you to the far edge.
291     You manage to get a grasp on the ledge, but the rock crumbles
291     away and you find yourself falling into the abyss.
292     Do you have a plan for negotiating that seven-foot crack?
293     It's much too steep to climb.
294     ** Unused **
295     Nice try, but it's a long way down.
296     Help!  You're falling!  Do something and save yourself!
297     The belt instantly becomes much lighter.  Unfortunately, the rapid
297     change in its momentum jerks the belt away from you.  Lazily, it
297     begins to float up while you keep falling down ... down ... down ...
298     As the belt buckle breaks, the belt rises for a brief instant and
298     then, like you, crashes to the floor below.
299     You can't get here.  This is where the amulet ends up.
300     The elves bow low as you pass.  The eldest approaches you and
300     says, "Go in peace and honor, Elf-Friend."
301     You are in the vault of the elves. 
302     You are in a secret armory which has been unused for ages.  There
302     was once a forge here, but most of it has been removed.
303     You have poled your boat across the dark water.
304     You are in a closet to the south of the reading room.
305     You are in a tall canyon which narrows to an tiny slit to
305     the west.  A wider path goes east.
306     You are floating gently to the bottom of the chasm and in the
306     distance can see the troll bridge above you.  Unfortunately,
306     at an even closer distance, you can see an entire family of
306     trolls who are poised to attack with battle axes drawn.
306     You try to defend yourself, but you are hopelessly outnumbered,
306     and even though your axe manages to dispatch one troll, the
306     next one is not so unlucky.  He brings his battle axe down
306     against your skull.  You see your life pass before you
306     against a backdrop of shimmering stars; then all is darkness.
307     You have poled your boat through the water into a narrow inlet.
308     You have poled your boat across the water, which appears to
308     become somewhat darker and more forbidding here.
309     You are on the edge of a beach which extends some distance to
309     the south before it runs into a sheer cliff face.  To the east,
309     there is a small path beside a dark stream which flows into
309     the lake.
310     You are standing at the edge of a dark pool which has a foul
310     and generally unpleasant smell.  The water from the pool flows
310     into a stream running to the west alongside a narrow path.  
310     The pool is quite shallow and you could easily wade across.
311     You are standing on one end of a massive stone slab which rises up
311     out of a murky pool here.  At the far end of the slab (which you
311     ought to be able to climb), you can see a dark cavern in the rock
311     face.  The water gets deeper to the north and south, but you could
311     wade across to the western edge.
312     You are standing in a shallow pool filled with cold and
312     unpleasant-smelling water.  Some twenty feet above you, a massive
312     slab of rock hangs precariously overhead.
313     You are standing on the west end of a large slab about twenty
313     feet above a murky pool.  This end of the slab is virtually
313     in mid-air and there is nothing nearby to jump to.
314     You are standing at the end of a massive rock slab which descends
314     westward into a murky pool.  This end of the slab is positioned
314     about twenty-five feet above the cavern floor.  You would not
314     survive a jump to the ground from here, but there is a ledge
314     about two feet to the east which you could easily reach.
314     The ledge leads inward to a dark cavern.
315     You are in a small chamber with no exits except a narrow
315     path which leads south.  High above you, there is a rock
315     slab at the same level as a ledge in the wall, but there
315     is no way to reach it.
316     You are standing on top of a rock slab resting on the floor
316     of a small chamber.  High above your head, there is a narrow
316     ledge in the rock wall, but there seems to be no way to reach
316     it from here.  A narrow path leads south from here.
317     You are on a small ledge high in the face of a rock wall.
317     Approximately two feet to the west is the top of a large
317     slab to which you could easily jump.  To the south, there
317     is a small cavern.
318     You are on a small ledge high in the face of a rock wall with
318     a small cavern to the south.
319     You are inside a small foul-smelling cavern which shows signs
319     of being the lair for some unfamiliar creature.  A small stream
319     flows through the cavern, but the channel is too narrow for you
319     to follow.  The only exit is to the north.
320     You are on a narrow path which enters from the north, bends
320     slightly and exits upward to the southeast.
321     You are in what appears to be a laboratory, with an exit to
321     the northeast.  The floor is covered with papers, and the
321     entire area is littered with scraps and tools.  There are a
321     few blueprints lying around haphazardly, but the whole place
321     is such a mess that I doubt you could find anything specific
321     in here.  At the south end of the room you can see a strange
321     contraption made from brass, ebony, ivory and glass.
322     You are in the ancient laboratory.
323     You are sitting inside the machine.  In front of you is a control
323     panel consisting of a set of clock dials covered by a glass face.
324     The spinning of the dials comes to a sudden halt.  There is
324     darkness.  You have materialized into solid rock.  This is not
324     good for your health.
325     As you exit from the machine and your eyes grow accustomed to the
325     the dim light of the laboratory, the source of the noise becomes
325     apparent in the form of a ghastly creature of a description not
325     known to your time.  Its red and glowing eyes have already spotted
325     you and it begins to snap at you with a giant set of claws.
325     Desperately, you run back toward the machine, but before you can
325     close the door for safety, a large claw reaches in, picks you up
325     and crunches your body.  The rest is too gory to describe.

1       Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in
1       treasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never
1       seen again.  Magic is said to work in the cave.  I will be your eyes
1       and hands.  Direct me with natural English commands; I don't under-
1       stand all of the English language, but I do a pretty good job.
1       (Should you get stuck, type "HELP" or "?" for some general hints.)
1       Good Luck!

2       A little dwarf with a big knife blocks your way.
3       A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you, threw a little
3       axe at you which missed, cursed, and ran away.
4       There is a threatening little dwarf in the room with you.
5       One sharp nasty knife is thrown at you.
6       None of them hit you.
7       One of them gets you!
8       A hollow voice says "Plugh".
9       There is no way to go in that direction.
10      I am unsure how you are facing.  Use compass points or nearby objects.
11      I don't know in from out here.  Use compass points or name something
11      in the general direction you want to go.
12      I don't know how to apply that word here.
13      I don't understand that.
14      I'm game.  Would you care to explain how?
15      I'm sorry, but in general I can't provide any additional details.
16      It is now pitch dark.  If you proceed you will likely fall into a pit.
17      If you prefer, simply type "W" rather than "West".
18      Are you trying to catch the bird?
19      The little bird is frightened now and you can't catch it.
20      Are you trying to somehow deal with the snake?
21      You can't kill the snake, or drive it away, or avoid it, or anything
21      like that.  There is a way to get by, but you don't have the necessary
21      resources right now.
22      Do you really want to quit now?
23      You fell into a pit and broke every bone in your body!
24      You are already carrying it.
25      You can't be serious!
26      The bird was unafraid when you entered, but as you get closer it
26      quickly looks at what you're carrying and seems to become quite
26      agitated, making it somewhat difficult to catch.
27      Watch your fingers!  You can catch the bird, but you cannot carry it.
28      There is nothing here with a lock.
29      You aren't carrying it.
30      The little bird attacks the green snake, and in an astounding flurry
30      drives the snake away.
31      You have no keys!
32      It has no lock.
33      I don't know how to lock or unlock such a thing.
34      It was already locked.
35      The grate is now locked.
36      The grate is now unlocked.
37      It was already unlocked.
38      You have no source of light.
39      Your lamp is now on.
40      Your lamp is now off.
41      There is no way to get past the bear to unlock the chain, which is
41      probably just as well.
42      Nothing happens.
43      Where?
44      There is nothing here to attack.
45      The bird is now dead.  Its body disappears.
46      Attacking the snake both doesn't work and is very dangerous.
47      You killed a little dwarf.
48      You attack a little dwarf, but he dodges out of the way.
49      With what?  Your bare hands?
50      Good try, but that is an old worn-out magic word.
51      I know of places, actions, and things.  Much of my vocabulary
51      describes places and is used to move you there.  To move, try words
51      like forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west, north, south,
51      up, or down.  I also know about a number of objects hidden within
51      the cave which can usually be manipulated with various action words.
51      - - -
51      It's important to remember that cave passages turn a lot, and
51      that leaving a room to the north does not guarantee entering the
51      next from the south, although it usually works out that way.
51      You'd best make yourself a map as you go along.
51      - - -
51      A word about my understanding of English -- I will try very hard to
51      do whatever you say, but here are a few suggested idioms:
51      - - -
51      To take everything at a location, say "take all" or "take everything".
51      Similarly, to drop everything you're carrying say "drop all".
51      - - -
51      You can string a list of commands or objects together by using the
51      word "and" or by separating them with commas.  Thus, you could say
51      "Go in the building and take the keys and the note."
51      - - -
51      The program remembers the last object you use and lets you use "it"
51      in a later reference.  Thus, you could say "take note and read it."
51      - - -
51      To reprint the detailed description of where you are, say "look"
51      (or "L").  You can also "look in" or "look at" appropriate objects.
51      - - -
51      To find out what you're carrying, use "take inventory" (or "I").
51      - - -
51      If you want to end your adventure, say "quit".
51      - - -
51      To see how well you're doing, say "score".  You get points by
51      finding treasures and adding them to your collection.  Each
51      treasure is associated with a point value.  You get 60% of the
51      point value simply by find the treasure; for the rest you must
51      bring it back and deposit it safely in the building.  To determine
51      how much an individual treasure is worth (assuming you get it back),
51      you can use the "appraise" command, as in "appraise poster".
51      - - -
51      Although most of the objects in the cave are of negligible weight,
51      there are a few (such as a 90-pound gold nugget) which are reasonably
51      heavy.  In case you need it, your own weight in this game is figured
51      at 130 pounds and you can carry (being an adventurer in reasonably
51      good shape) up to 100 pounds of additional material.  To find out
51      how much some object weighs, you may say "weigh <object>".
51      - - -
51      If you think you've found all the treasures, just keep exploring
51      for a while.  If nothing interesting happens, you haven't found
51      them all yet.  If something interesting does happen, it means
51      you're getting a bonus and have an opportunity to garner many
51      more points in the Master's Section.
51      - - -
51      I may occasionally offer hints if you seem to be having trouble.
51      If I do, I'll warn you in advance how much it will affect your
51      score to accept the hints.
51      - - -
51      Finally, adventurers should regularly check the billboard for
51      announcements of current interest.
51      - - -
51      ADVENTURE was originally developed by Willie Crowther; more recent
51      additions have been made by Don Woods, David Long, Mark Edwards,
51      Mark Sylvester, Eric Roberts.
51      - - -
52      It misses.
53      It gets you!
54      Ok
55      You can't unlock the keys.
56      You have crawled around in some little holes and wound up back in the
56      main passage.
57      I don't know where the cave is, but hereabouts no stream can run on
57      the surface for long.  I would try the stream.
58      I need more detailed instructions to do that.
59      I can only tell you what you see as you move about and manipulate
59      things.  I cannot tell you where remote things are.
60      I can't make any sense out of that.
61      What?
62      Are you trying to get into the cave?
63      The grate is very solid and has a hardened steel lock.  You cannot
63      enter without a key, and there are no keys nearby.  I would recommend
63      looking elsewhere for the keys.
64      The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple, with an
64      occasional grove of pine or spruce.  There is quite a bit of under-
64      growth, largely birch and ash saplings plus nondescript bushes of
64      various sorts.  This time of year visibility is quite restricted by
64      all the leaves, but travel is quite easy if you detour around the
64      spruce and berry bushes.
65      Welcome to ADVENTURE!!  Would you like instructions?
66      Digging without a shovel is quite impractical.  Even with a shovel
66      progress is unlikely.
67      Blasting requires dynamite.
68      I'm as confused as you are.
69      Mist is a white vapor, usually water, seen from time to time in
69      caverns.  It can be found anywhere but is frequently a sign of a deep
69      pit leading down to water.
70      Your feet are now wet.
71      I think I just lost my appetite.
72      Thank you, it was delicious.
73      You have taken a drink from the clear water.  The water tastes
73      strongly of minerals, but is not unpleasant.  It is extremely cold.
74      The bottle is now empty.
75      Rubbing the electric lamp is not particularly rewarding.  Anyway,
75      nothing exciting happens.
76      Peculiar.  Nothing unexpected happens.
77      Your bottle is empty and the ground is wet.
78      You can't pour that.
79      Watch it!
80      Which way?
81      Oh dear, you seem to have gotten yourself killed.  I might be able to
81      help you out, but I've never really done this before.  Do you want me
81      to try to reincarnate you?
82      All right.  But don't blame me if something goes wr......
82      *                    --- POOF!! ---                    *
82      You are engulfed in a cloud of orange smoke.  Coughing and gasping,
82      you emerge from the smoke and find....
83      You clumsy oaf, you've done it again!  I don't know how long I can
83      keep this up.  Do you want me to try reincarnating you again?
84      Okay, now where did I put my orange smoke?....  >POOF!<
84      Everything disappears in a dense cloud of orange smoke.
85      Now you've really done it!  I'm out of orange smoke!  You don't expect
85      me to do a decent reincarnation without any orange smoke, do you?
86      Okay, if you're so smart, do it yourself!  I'm leaving!
90      >>> Messages 81 thru 90 are reserved for "Obituaries". <<<
91      Sorry, but I no longer seem to remember how it was you got here.
92      It's too heavy.  You'll have to drop something first.
93      You can't go through a locked steel grate.
94      I believe what you want is right here with you.
95      You don't fit through a two-inch slit.
96      I respectfully suggest you go across the bridge instead of jumping.
97      There is no way across the fissure.
98      You're not carrying anything.
99      You are currently holding the following:
100     It's not hungry.  Besides, you have no bird seed.
101     The snake has now devoured your bird.
102     There's nothing here it wants to eat (except perhaps you).
103     You fool, dwarves eat only coal!  Now you've made him *REALLY* mad!!
104     Your cask is empty and the ground is soaked.
105     You aren't carrying them.
106     I don't need to, thank you.
107     The ground is wet and the air is smelly.
108     Your lamp is now on, but the glare from the walls is absolutely
108     blinding.  If you proceed you are likely to fall into a pit.
109     You haven't any matches.
110     Don't be ridiculous!
111     The door is extremely rusty and refuses to open.
112     The plant indignantly shakes dry its leaves and asks, "Water?"
113     The hinges are quite thoroughly rusted now and won't budge.
114     The oil has freed up the hinges so that the door will now move,
114     although it requires some effort.
115     The plant has exceptionally deep roots and cannot be pulled free.
116     The dwarves' knives vanish as they strike the walls of the cave.
117     Something you're carrying won't fit through the tunnel with you.
117     You'd best take inventory and drop something.
118     You can't fit this five-foot clam through that little passage.
119     You can't fit this five-foot oyster through that little passage.
120     I advise you to put down the clam before opening it.  >Strain!<
121     I advise you to put down the oyster before opening it.  >Wrench!<
122     You don't have anything strong enough to open the clam.
123     You don't have anything strong enough to open the oyster.
124     A glistening pearl falls out of the clam and rolls away.  Goodness,
124     this must really be an oyster.  (I never was very good at identifying
124     bivalves.)  Whatever it is, it has now snapped shut again.
125     The oyster creaks open, revealing nothing but oyster inside.  It
125     promptly snaps shut again.
126     You have crawled around in some little holes and found your way
126     blocked by a recent cave-in.  You are now back in the main passage.
127     There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.
128     Out from the shadows behind you pounces a bearded pirate!  "Har, har,"
128     he chortles, "I'll just take all this booty and hide it away with me
128     chest deep in the maze!"  He snatches your treasure and vanishes into
128     the gloom.
129     The sepulchral voice reverberates through the cave: "The cave is
129     closing now.  See you at the Devil's Chair."
130     A mysterious recorded voice groans into life and announces:
130     "This exit is closed.  You'll have to find another way."
131     It looks as though you're dead.  Well, seeing as how it's so close to
131     closing time anyway, I think we'll just call it a day.
132     The sepulchral voice entones, "The cave is now closed."  As the echoes
132     fade, there is a blinding flash of light (and a small puff of orange
132     smoke). . . .    As your eyes refocus, you look around and find. . .
133     There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
133     wall, burying the dwarves in the rubble.  You march through the hole
133     and find yourself in the Main Office, where a cheering band of
133     friendly elves carry the conquering adventurer off into the sunset.
134     There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
134     wall, burying the snakes in the rubble.  A river of molten lava pours
134     in through the hole, destroying everything in its path, including you!
135     There is a loud explosion, and you are suddenly splashed across the
135     walls of the room.
136     The resulting ruckus has awakened the dwarves.  There are now several
136     threatening little dwarves in the room with you!  Most of them throw
136     knives at you!  All of them get you!
137     Oh, leave the poor unhappy bird alone.
138     I daresay whatever you want is around here somewhere.
139     I'm not sure what you mean by "Stop".  Use "Quit" if you want to give
139     up.
140     You can't get there from here.
141     You are being followed by a very large, tame bear.
142     -              *** THE HISTORY OF ADVENTURE ***                 -
142     -              --------------------------------                 -
142     Once upon a time, a group of adventurers, out to seek their fame
142     and fortune, mounted an expedition against the evil Necromancer of
142     Mirkwood to rescue a captured wizard.  One of the stalwart members
142     of that party was a experienced thief named Willie Crowther, who
142     (on those few occasions when the Dungeons and Dragons game gave way
142     to other pursuits) was also employed as a magic user (with a general
142     specialty in computer wizardry) at Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. in
142     Cambridge, MA.  There, restless by the lack of excitement and magic, 
142     he descended into the depths of the netherworld of programming
142     and brought forth the first version of Adventure.  Willie's other
142     interests include spelunking, and the geography of Adventure is
142     modelled on a real cavern, called Colossal Cave, which is a part
142     of Kentucky's Mammoth Caverns.
142     - - -
142     Shortly after completing the original version, Willie Crowther
142     moved to the magical lands of California and little was heard
142     about Adventure for some time.  After about a year, Don Woods
142     and other programmers at Stanford discovered Willie's program,
142     made significant revisions, and greatly expanded the cave.
142     - - -
142     More recent additions were made in 1978 by David Long while
142     at the University of Chicago, Graduate School of Business.
142     In the process, the code was heavily rewritten to permit more
142     generalized handling of objects and to allow a far more complex
142     syntax.
142     - - -
142     From there, additional modifications and extensions have been
142     made at Wellesley College by Mark Edwards, Mark Sylvester and,
142     most recently, Eric Roberts who, in the circular history of these
142     affairs, also designed and refereed the original Dungeons and
142     Dragons adventure in which Willie Crowther first played.  The
142     puzzle of the ruby diadem and so forth was designed by Kristin
142     Powers and was the winning entry in the Great Adventure contest.

142     Scribbled in the margin of the last page of the book, there is
142     an obscure notation which reads "I have carved the combination
142     to the safe into the rocks of the cave where it will be covered
142     by the dusts of time."
143     Do you indeed wish to quit now?
144     There is nothing here with which to fill the vase.
145     The sudden change in temperature has delicately shattered the vase.
146     It is beyond your power to do that.
147     I don't know how.
148     It is too far up for you to reach.
149     You killed a little dwarf.  The body vanishes in a cloud of greasy
149     black smoke.
150     The shell is very strong and is impervious to attack.
151     What's the matter, can't you read?  Now you'd best start over.
152     The axe bounces harmlessly off the dragon's thick scales.
153     The dragon looks rather nasty.  You'd best not try to get by.
154     The little bird attacks the green dragon, and in an astounding flurry
154     gets burnt to a cinder.  The ashes blow away.
155     On what?
156     Okay, from now on I'll only describe a place in full the first time
156     you come to it.  To get the full description, say "LOOK".
157     Trolls are close relatives with the rocks and have skin as tough as
157     that of a rhinoceros.  The troll fends off your blows effortlessly.
158     The troll deftly catches the axe, examines it carefully, and tosses it
158     back, declaring, "Good workmanship, but it's not valuable enough."
159     The troll catches your treasure and scurries away out of sight.
160     The troll refuses to let you cross.
161     There is no longer any way across the chasm.
162     Just as you reach the other side, the bridge buckles beneath the
162     weight of the bear, which was still following you around.  You
162     scramble desperately for support, but as the bridge collapses you
162     stumble back and fall into the chasm.
163     The bear lumbers toward the troll, who lets out a startled shriek and
163     scurries away.  The bear soon gives up the pursuit and wanders back.
164     The axe misses and lands near the bear where you can't get at it.
165     With what?  Your bare hands?  Against *HIS* bear hands??
166     The bear is confused; he only wants to be your friend.
167     For crying out loud, the poor thing is already dead.
168     The bear eagerly licks up the honeycomb, after which he seems to calm
168     down considerably and even becomes rather friendly.
169     The bear is still chained to the wall.
170     The chain is still locked.
171     The chain is now unlocked.
172     The chain is now locked.
173     There is nothing here to which the chain can be locked.
174     There is nothing here to eat.
175     Do you want the hint?
176     Do you need help getting out of the maze?
177     You can make the passages look less alike by dropping things.
178     Are you trying to explore beyond the Plover Room?
179     There is a draft coming through the cracks in the ceiling,
179     as if they lead up into some larger room.
180     Do you need help getting out of here?
181     Don't go west.  Try your luck with the other directions.
182     Gluttony is not one of the troll's vices.  Avarice, however, is.
183     Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best start wrapping this up, unless
183     you can find some fresh batteries.  I seem to recall there's a vending
183     machine in the maze.  Bring some coins with you.
184     Your lamp has run out of power.
185     There's not much point in wandering around out here, and you can't
185     explore the cave without a lamp.  So let's just call it a day.
186     There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.  As you
186     turn toward them, the beam of your lamp falls across a bearded pirate.
186     He is carrying a large chest.  "Shiver me timbers!", he cries, "I've
186     been spotted!  I'd best hie meself off to the maze to hide me chest!"
186     With that, he vanishes into the gloom.
187     Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best replace those batteries.
188     Your lamp is now shining with renewed strength.
189     Your lamp is getting dim, and you haven't any more coins.  You'd
189     best start wrapping this up.
190     I'm afraid that the magazine is written in Dwarvish.  However, it
190     consists primarily of pictures and seems to be a travel brochure
190     of some sort.  Although you can't make out all of the destinations,
190     there are several shots of two women riding motorcycles around an
190     island resort, while other pictures seem to be from completely
190     different times.
191     "This is not the maze where the pirate leaves his treasure chest."
192     There is a message on the oyster which reads:  "As a Master
192     Adventurer, you are now permitted to save your games."
193     The cask is valueless by itself.  On the other hand, if you could
193     fill it with vintage wine. . .
194     It says the same thing it did before.
195     I'm afraid I don't understand.
196     "Congratulations on bringing light into the dark-room!"
197     You strike the mirror a resounding blow, whereupon it shatters into a
197     myriad tiny fragments.
198     You have taken the vase and hurled it delicately to the ground.
199     You prod the nearest dwarf, who wakes up grumpily, takes one look at
199     you, curses, and grabs for his axe.
200     Is this acceptable?
201     Use SAVE and RESTORE to save your game state.
202     You managed to climb about halfway up before losing your hold and
202     sliding back.
203     You were only a few yards from the top when you slipped and tumbled
203     all the way back down.
204     Ok, ok.  No need to be grabby.
205     Pulling an angry bear around is a good way to get your arm ripped off.
206     The sword is now very clean.
207     The sword is now covered with oil.
208     The handle is now too slippery to grasp.
209     It's not very safe to wear a sword without a scabbard.
210     You are already wearing it.
211     Do you want to extract the sword from the anvil?
212     If you could convince me of your royal blood, you might get somewhere.
213     Are you trying to go up the slide?
214     Perhaps you should look for a different way to get to the top
214     of the slide.
215     You grasp the sword's handle and pull, but the sword won't budge.
215     Do you want to try yanking it out?
216     A tiny water sprite runs out of the forest toward you.  When she
216     sees you, she utters the syllable "phuce" and disappears.
217     You can't swim.  You'd best go by boat.
218     The boat's oars were stolen by the dwarves to play bing-bong.
218     (That's dwarvish ping-pong -- with rocks!).  You have no way
218     to propel the boat.
219     You are still in the boat.  It is too heavy to carry.
220     You had better leave the boat first.
221     You are now sitting in a small boat.
222     You couldn't possibly cross this sea without a large ship.
223     The cliff is unscalable.
224     Your keys are all too large for the lock.
225     The wall is too smooth to climb.
226     The shelf is beyond your reach.
227     You are already wearing them.
228     You thought maybe these were peyote??  You feel a little dizzy,
228     but nothing happens.
229     You are growing taller, expanding like a telescope!  Just before
229     your head strikes the top of the chamber, the mysterious process
229     stops as suddenly as it began.
230     You are closing up like an accordion....shrinking..shrinking.  You
230     are now your normal size.
231     You have smashed your bottle all over the ground.
232     You are now too big to leave the way you came in.
233     This is obviously an elfin entrance and is much too small for
233     you to fit through.  I'd suggest you look elsewhere for advice.
233     Maybe you should go ask Alice.
234     The wrought-iron door is now locked.
235     The tiny door is now locked.
236     The wrought-iron door is now unlocked.
237     The tiny door is now unlocked.
238     You are blocked by a wall of solid rock.
239     >$<
240     The Wumpus looks at the food with distaste.  He looks at *YOU* with
240     relish!
241     You have jerked the cloak free of the rocks.  However, in doing
241     so you have caused a small rockslide, blocking the entrance
241     and making an unholy din.
242     The cloak is stuck tight under the rocks.  You'll probably have to
242     yank it out.
243     The Wumpus grabs the axe, stops and picks his teeth with it for a few
243     moments while looking thoughtfully at you.  When he finishes picking
243     his teeth, he eats the axe, belches noisily, and starts after
243     you again.
244     As the bridge disappears, the Wumpus scrambles frantically to reach
244     your side of the fissure.  He misses by inches, and with a horrible
244     shriek plunges to his death in the depths of the fissure!
245     You can't even hit a sleeping Wumpus!  The axe is now lying too near
245     the Wumpus for you to retrieve it.
246     The Wumpus is between you and the axe.  You can't reach it.
247     You can't fit through a six-inch door.
248     The dog easily dodges the axe, which lands beyond him where you can't
248     get at it.
249     The dog wolfs (natch) down the food and looks around hungrily for
249     more.  However, he does not appear to be any better disposed towards
249     your presence.
250     You've got to be kidding.
251     It's attached to the wall.
252     You can't put a thing into itself.
253     The gnome firmly blocks the door of the booth.  You can't enter.
254     The constant ringing has awakened the dwarves!
254     There are now several threatening little dwarves in the room with
254     you!  Most of them throw knives at you!  All of them get you!
255     The telephone is out of order.
256     The telephone is out of order and your hand is sore.
257     A couple of lead slugs drop from the coinbox and clatter noisily
257     on the floor, but you've broken the phone beyond all hope.
258     He wants treasure, not gab.
259     He didn't say anything.
260     It isn't a parrot.  He didn't say anything.
261     No one replies.  The line goes dead with a faint "Click".
262     I think you are a little confused.
263     *****
264     He isn't hungry.
265     As the blast of the horn reverberates through the chamber, the
265     seemingly solid rock wall crumbles away, revealing another room just
265     beyond.  The wall was most likely worn thin by an ancient watercourse
265     which dried up just before completely wearing away the rock.
266     The chamber reverberates to the blast of the horn.
267     The bees swarm over the fresh flowers, leaving the hive unguarded
267     and revealing a sweet honeycomb.
268     You quickly run out of breath -- adventuring is tiring work.
269     It isn't ringing.
270     A hairy paw reaches out of the darkness and....
271     You don't have the correct change.
272     You go a short way down the bright passage, but the light
272     grows to blinding intensity.  You can't continue.
273     You know, if you type "BRIEF", I won't have to keep repeating these
273     long descriptions of each room.
274     Are you trying to reach the natural bridge?
275     You can't get to it by climbing the walls or jumping or anything
275     like that, but people have been known to find other ways to get
275     over the rainbow.
276     You turkey!!!  Now you've done it!  It took some effort, but you
276     woke up the Wumpus.  He slowly opens one red eye, and then another,
276     and then one more (!!), and looks at you sleepily.  He had been
276     dreaming of a late snack.  If you don't act quickly, you'll
276     be a *late* adventurer!
277     The blast of your horn echos throughout hill and dale.
278     All you have are watercress sandwiches.  The bear is less than
278     interested.
279     You have smashed your sword to smithereens against a rock.
280     Setting yourself adrift in the boat with no way to propel it would
280     not be very smart.  Best to keep the pole.
281     You're already in it.
282     A couple of lead slugs fall out of the coinbox and clatter heavily
282     on the floor of the booth.
283     Whoops!  The floor has opened out from under you!  It seems you
283     have fallen into a bottomless pit.  As a matter of fact, you're
283     still falling!  Well, I have better things to do than wait around
283     for you to strike bottom, so let's just assume you're dead.
283     Sorry about that, Chief.
284     The telephone in the booth has begun to ring.
285     I don't understand what you are trying to do.
286     How do you propose to cross the river?
287     The air is filled with beautiful music.
288     The air fills with beautiful music.  The dog gradually becomes
288     less fierce, and after a short while he lies down by the side of
288     the cavern and falls into a deep sleep.
289     Are you trying to get past the dog?
290     The only person I can remember who managed to get past the dog
290     was that singer, ummm, what's his name... Euridice's friend....
291     That wouldn't be wise.  It is best to let sleeping dogs lie.
292     The stream flows out of one very small crack and into another.
292     You can't go that way.
293     The river is too wide and deep to cross.
294     The glare is absolutely blinding.  If you proceed you are likely
294     to fall into a pit.
295     The hum of the bees rises to an angry buzz as you move towards
295     the hive.
296     The sticks and branches are all in a tangle and are stuck in the
296     mud.  You'd need a shovel to dig them out.
297     You're already carrying them.
298     The chalice is slightly cracked.  It won't hold any liquids.
299     The cask is now empty.
300     The wine goes right to your head.  You reel around in a drunken
300     stupor and finally pass out.  You awaken with a splitting headache,
300     and try to focus your eyes....
301     Yeeeecchhh!!
302     Your bottle is already full.
303     The cask is already full.
304     There is nothing here with which to fill the bottle.
305     There is nothing here which you would want to put into the cask.
306     Your bottle is now full of water.
307     The cask is now full of water.
308     Your bottle is now full of oil.
309     The cask is now full of oil.
310     The bottle is now full of wine.
311     The cask is now full of wine.
312     You have nothing in which to carry it.
313     You can't fill that.
314     Do you want it in the bottle or the cask?
315     Your containers are both full.
316     It's empty.
317     Hmmm, I see you have already gone through an extra set of batteries.
317     I'll get rid of the trash for you.
318     The bridge shakes as you cross.  Large hunks of clay and rock near
318     the edge break off and hurtle far down into the chasm.  Several of
318     the cracks on the bridge surface widen perceptibly.
319     The load is too much for the bridge!  With a roar, the entire
319     structure gives way, plunging you headlong into abyss.
320     You can't get at him.  He is inside the phone booth.
321     Your lamp is already on.
322     Your lamp is already off.
323     Your lamp is again growing dim.  You'd better get some more batteries.
324     You know, you are wasting your batteries by wandering around out
324     here with your light on.
325     <$>
326     Dead wumpi, as a rule, are light eaters.  Nothing happens.
327     How do expect to feed a sleeping Wumpus?
328     You aren't holding it.
329     It won't fit.
330     The coin drops into the slot with a dull "clunk".  There is no
330     dial tone.
331     It's already there.
332     Thank you for your comments.  They will be dispatched immediately
332     via Gnome Express to the Enchanter.
333     The chest is now unlocked.
334     The chest is now locked.
335     I can't reach inside.
336     It's already open.
337     It's locked.
338     It's already closed.
339     You can't fill that.  It would leak all over the place.
340     It's not inside anything.
341     It isn't there.
342     How?
343     Taken.
344     Dropped.
345     I don't think I can.
346     Interesting.  How?
347     Huh?
348     You are in perfect health.
349     You are fit as a fiddle.
350     Only wizards can do that!
351     Are you kidding?  Do you want to suffocate the poor thing?
352     Thrown.
353     Left.
354     You can't get close enough for a clean thrust.
355     As you move in for the kill, the dwarf neatly slips a knife
355     between your ribs.
356     As you approach, the dwarf slashes out with his knife.
357     It's too dark to see anything.
358     It's not open.
359     There's nothing inside.
360     It contains:
361     The glass window holds:
362     Hidden behind the poster is a steel safe, embedded in the wall.
363     Brushing the dust from one of the larger rocks reveals some carved
363     characters.
364     You have moved the dust around, but you haven't found anything.
365     The safe door smoothly swings open.
366     Maybe if you rubbed your fingertips with sandpaper....
367     The safe's door clicks shut.
368     This is a combination safe.  The keys won't help.
369     I certainly can't read in this light.
370     The poster has a picture of a thin man with a long white beard.
370     He is wearing a high pointed cap embroidered with strange symbols,
370     and he is pointing a finger at you.  Below the picture are the words:
370     "I want you . . . to report any problems with this game to me without
370     delay.  Please mail any suggestions to eroberts@cs.stanford.edu."
371     "Click."
372     In the rock is carved the message "7, 22, 34".
373     You can't get at them.
374     Ok, I'll give you the full description whenever you enter a room
374     for the first time.
375     You don't have the right key.
376     That's not strong enough to open the clam.
377     That's not strong enough to open the oyster.
378     The top of the bottle is too small.  You can't get it in.
379     There is only a small hole in one end of the cask.  You can't force
379     anything solid through the hole.

381     You are a bit off top form, but nothing to worry about.
382     You are weaker than usual.  Better avoid fights.
383     You really ought to take a break.  You're in tough shape.
384     You are on the edge of collapse.  Lots of sun and fresh air will
384     speed your recovery.

391     Is it hot in here?  You are flushed and sweating.
392     You are feeling definitely peculiar, weak....
393     You're dizzy, nauseous.  You can barely stand.
394     You are really ill.  If you don't find an antidote soon, it's
394     curtains.
395     You are a walking wound.  You are very weak.  You'd better find out
395     what's wrong before it's too late.
396     Sheeesh!  What a mess!  Your hair has fallen out and your skin is
396     covered with blisters.  And not an aspirin in sight.
397     Well, you tried, but your strength is gone.  The agony is finally
397     over.

400     The crystal ball is murky when you first look inside; as you watch,
400     however, the crystal becomes clear and a definite image takes shape.
401     There seems to be a greenish light coming through the slit.
402     There's too much water to see anything through the slit.
403     There is nothing here which opens.
404     There is nothing here to board.
405     There is nothing here to get out of.
406     The statue depicts a leprechaun holding a small pot of gold.
407     The little bird flies out of the cage and settles on the ground.
408     The door to the phone booth seems to be stuck open.  At any rate,
408     you can't seem to shut it.
409     You are back on dry land.
410     The walls of the cave seem to fade away and you get a brief glimpse
410     of the building, but you find yourself incredibly strained by the
410     weight of the gold nugget which suddenly seemed to triple.  The
410     image fades and you find yourself back where you started.
411     That's interesting.  It seems that the oyster shell was only
411     stuck because as soon as you started to loosen it with the
411     crowbar, it sprung open to reveal an empty shell with a pool
411     of water inside.
412     This oyster seems to be much larger than the other one.  In any
412     event, it is much too heavy for you to lift.
413     The hinge is broken and the oyster won't close.
414     Just before you start to sweep away the dust in front of the
414     grate you notice that there are tiny footprints which lead
414     through the grate and out again on the other side.
415     A couple of lead slugs drop from the coinbox onto the pillow.
416     That doesn't burn.
417     You can't ignite something with that.
418     You've nothing to burn it with.
419     The match isn't lit.
420     It burns and is consumed, except for a few ashes which blow
420     away as a draft passes through the room.  Not much heat though.
421     The magazine burns quickly, giving off greasy black smoke and
421     considerable heat.  Cheap dwarf paper, no doubt.
422     The manuscript burns beautifully, its colored inks producing a
422     multicolored flame.
423     The oil catches fire explosively!  The flames flare up all around
423     you!  Oh, help!  You're on fire!!!!! OOOOoooohhhhhh.......
424     The match flares up brightly.
425     Don't you think you'd better drop it first?
426     The match has gone out.
427     On the inside cover, you read the following:

428     By the way, the matchbook contains five matches.
429     By the way, the matchbook contains four matches.
430     By the way, the matchbook contains three matches.
431     By the way, the matchbook contains two matches.
432     By the way, the matchbook contains only one match.
433     By the way, the matchbook is empty.
434     The cliff wall, loosely translated from the Elvish, reads
434     "Speak, friend, and enter."
435     Slowly, the great door swings shut and its outlines vanish
435     into the rock.
436     Silently, a great door is outlined in the rock face.  Slowly
436     it swings inward on unseen hinges.  At the same time, the
436     writing disappears.
437     It won't fit.
438     The inside of the doors read, "These doors are controlled
438     by word of command.  I, Narvi, made them."
439     I don't see how pushing that does anything.
440     The belt begins to float away but quickly comes back down.
441     You feel a bit lighter, but nothing else happens.
443     The plant spurts into furious growth for a few seconds.
444     The plant grows explosively, almost filling the bottom of the pit.
445     You've over-watered the plant!  It's shriveling up!  It's, it's...
446     I don't think melting that will do any good.
447     Good idea.  Look for something that burns reasonably well.
448     There's not enough heat to melt the leading.
449     You see a road below you, which winds off toward a building in the
449     distance.  You seem to be in a tower on top of a forested hill.
450     The Venetian glass shatters into a million worthless pieces.
451     The amulet is inscribed with letters in the black script of
451     Mordor, but you can't decipher the words.
452     You see the reflection of a tired adventurer.
453     You see the reflection of a tired adventurer, but as you watch,
453     the mirror starts to turn dark and foreboding.  In the center,
453     you see a replica of the amulet you have found except that the
453     image has an evil-looking red eye superimposed.
454     You look in the mirror expecting to see your reflection, but
454     what stares back at you is an evil necromancer wearing an
454     amulet exactly like yours.
455     The ground under you seems to shake, and broad tongues of flame
455     leap from the depths of the earth.  Steam rises as new fissures
455     spring up all around.  For a moment, you are completely blinded
455     by the combination of fire and steam, and you feel yourself
455     slipping into the abyss.  Suddenly, everything seems to be
455     stilled.  The world is dark around you and nothing happens
455     for a few moments . . .
456     When the light returns, you find yourself somehow magically
456     transported onto a green hillside.  On each side of you stands a
456     tree; one showers you with golden light, while the other bathes you
456     in a silvery sheen.  An elven queen, perhaps even Galadriel herself,
456     stands before you.  She is silent for a moment, but then smiles
456     and says: "You have destroyed the Amulet of Morgoth and brought
456     light back to these trees.  For this deed I name you an Elf-friend."
456     She raises her right hand and touches your forehead.  You close
456     your eyes, and when you open them you find yourself back at
456     the volcano which seems to have quieted.  There is a scroll
456     at your feet.
457     For a moment before you can read the words, you are transfixed
457     by the beauty of the scroll itself, which is inscribed in the
457     most beautiful Elvish calligraphy you have ever seen.  With
457     some effort, you manage to translate the message:
457     +------------------------------------------------------+   
457     |  Be it hereby known that the bearer of this scroll   |
457     |  is a hero of our age and has earned the title of    |
457     |  Elf-Friend throughout eternity.                     |
457     |                                -- Galadriel          |
457     +------------------------------------------------------+   
458     The elves stand up as one and refuse to let you pass.
459     The note is written in a child's handwriting and reads:
459     Earlier today, me and some friends decided to go down to
459     the cave.  We borrowed your lamp and went in a ways.
459     You know how neat it is to turn off the lamp and see
459     how dark everything gets?  Anyway, we did that and then
459     there was this noise and we all ran back to the entrance,
459     but I was so scared I dropped the lamp.  Hope you don't
459     get too mad at me."  The note is signed by T. Sawyer.
460     Many of the letters in the dust are no longer readable.
460     What you can make out is "----ROY IN -----NO."
461     It will take a tremendous amount of heat to melt the amulet.
462     It doesn't roll very well.
463     The hoop rolls around in a circle and falls on its side.
464     The hoop rolls down a slight incline, picks up speed and
464     crashes into the rock.  You hear a slight crack before it
464     falls over.
465     You are blocked by the stone slab.
466     The hoop is more delicate than it appears and you are able
466     to crack it easily.

468     The stalagmite cracks and splits apart leaving a passage to
468     the north.
469     The two halves of the stalagmite slam back together leaving
469     no visible cracks.
470     The dwarf makes a quick thrust, but the knife is turned
470     aside by your coat of mail.
471     There is no room to stand on top of the broken stalagmite.
472     The knife bounces harmlessly of your mithril coat.
473     The knives bounce harmlessly of your mithril coat.
474     There is a poem inscribed on the base of the elephant:
474     "Grey as a mouse, big as a house, nose like a snake . . ."
474     The poem goes on for several more lines and is signed
474     by S. Gamgee.
475     The tarnished ring vanishes from your hands.
476     There is a tingling sensation in your hand and you notice
476     that the ring is gone.
477     Ugh!  What a tight fit.  Typical Federal construction.
478     As you squeeze through, you notice that the ring slips off
478     and disappears.
479     As your size changes, you feel the ring slip away from you
479     and disappear.
480     There is no way you can fit through that.
481     The belt seems to be making more of a whirring noise than
481     usual when you press the button.  Probably it's nothing.
482     The belt is definitely beginning to overheat.  I suggest
482     not using it for fifty turns.
483     The belt emits a high pitched whine and the buckle snaps
483     down the middle.
484     The burned-out belt doesn't do much of anything.
485     Don't you know that using GOTO's is a bad idea?
486     I'm neither a locksmith or a burglar.
487     I don't see where you want it dropped.
488     You don't fit through an eight-inch hole.
489     The sack feels surprising light when you take it.
490     Even though it is made of silk, the cloak feels quite warm.
491     A large slab of stone rumbles into place and blocks the stairway.
492     You hear a rumbling noise nearby and the ground shakes
492     slightly.  Then all is still.
493     The slab of stone slides back into the wall.
494     As you utter the magic word, the spirit form of the dead
494     Wumpus appears before you and says in a menacing voice:
494     "You shall not escape with my ring.  My magic is stronger than
494     yours."  The image fades, and you are still where you were.
495     As you try to leave the cave, the shade of the former Wumpus
495     appears before you and presses firmly against the bars of
495     the grate so that you are unable to exit.  The spirit speaks
495     in low tones: "You can't escape this way."  The monstrous
495     form laughs and then is gone.
496     After taking a bite of the mushroom, you feel slightly dizzy
496     and off-balance.  In your distorted consciousness, you seem
496     to be able to see a much wider expanse of landscape, as if
496     you had suddenly grown to several times your normal size.
496     The effect lasts for a few moments, after which your head
496     seems to clear and you find yourself back to normal.
497     After taking a bite of the mushroom, you begin to feel yourself
497     growing larger, right up to the walls of the cave.  Unfortunately,
497     you don't stop there and you keep right on growing until . . .
498     After taking a bite of the mushroom, you feel yourself growing
498     larger, until you are almost the right size for this room.
498     From this vantage point, you see a note scribbled on a calendar
498     which reads "SUNDAY -- remember to pray at the Altar."
499     The cake is inscribed with the words "eat me."
500     The shadowy figure seems to be staring at you.
501     The shadowy figure waves back.
502     You wave, but nothing happens.
503     From its tip, the rod gives off a shower of crystalline sparks
503     which fall to the floor and wander aimlessly, pausing for a moment
503     at each crack in the floor.  Shortly, as if tiring of their search,
503     the sparks return to the wand.
504     I don't see anything written here.
505     I don't see anything special about it.
506     I don't see anything special about them.
507     The rod showers a cascade of crystalline sparks which seem
507     to gain shape and substance over the chasm.  In moments,
507     a shimmering crystal bridge spans the fissure.
508     The bridge dissolves into a constellation of sparks which
508     are drawn back into the rod.
509     The throne is carved out of solid rock and is not ornamented
509     with any obvious jewels.
510     You sit down momentarily on the cold floor of the cave,
510     but it's somewhat uncomfortable and you stand up again.
511     You sit down in the sunshine.  Things seem relatively pleasant,
511     but there's an adventure awaiting and you stand back up.
512     You are sitting on the throne of the Mountain King.
513     You have climbed down from the throne.
514     You'd better leave the throne first.
516     As you utter the word, a secret mechanism below the floor springs
516     to life, and the throne silently spins around into the wall.
517     Separate numbers in the combination with commas, not hyphens.
518     Nothing happens when you say that here, but it's a genuine magic word.
519     When the syllable fades from your lips, you have a fleeting
519     sensation that you are shrinking into nothingness.  The feeling
519     leaves you dizzy and you stumble over.  You are caught by
519     a tiny sprite who gets you back to your feet and says,
519     "This is a silly time to use that magic word."  She then
519     mumbles some magical spell of her own, and you find yourself
519     growing back to normal size.
520     As you wave the rod, the sparks seem to take on shape and
520     substance in the form of a bridge.  Unfortunately, the
520     bridge is the wrong size for the chasm and the sparks
520     fade and return slowly to the rod.
521     Please mail your suggestions to eroberts@cs.stanford.edu.
522     You're already there.
523     You are growing rapidly back to your normal size.
524     The dust gets blown around a bit, but if you keep this up, you
524     won't be able to breathe.  I suggest you look for a broom.
525     There is no way to get through the solid cliff wall.
526     The book is closed, but the title on the front reads
526     "The History of Adventure" by the Enchanter.
527     It's not a treasure.
528     5 points.
529     10 points.
530     15 points!
531     20 points!!
532     25 points!!!
533     I don't know.  It may be valuable, but I have a bad feeling about it.
534     You've run out of matches.
535     That word is not effective here.  My, I'm surprised anyone remembers
535     it at all.
536     Isn't that from Shakespeare?  In any case, nothing happens.
537     This is a receipt for a throne which, according to what's written
537     here, was built by the dwarves for the Mountain King.  Attached to
537     the receipt is a copy of the delivery notice, which reads:
537     "Magic word: KLARF.  Use to escape from bothersome visitors."
538     The trumpet makes some noise, but the room is very noisy already.
539     I don't see anything like that here.
540     That could be a few things.  Be more specific.
541     There is a warning message on the inside of the belt, which reads
541     "Do not allow belt to overheat."  The belt feels cold now.
542     There is a warning message on the inside of the belt, which reads
542     "Do not allow belt to overheat."  The belt feels somewhat warm.
543     There is a warning message on the inside of the belt, which reads
543     "Do not allow belt to overheat."  The belt feels quite hot!
544     The paper reads: "Gone for the day.  Visiting sick snake.  -- M.K."
545     I can't get to it.
546     The bottle of oil goes out.
547     As you utter the magic word, you immediately become disoriented
547     and you feel like your body is twisting and turning in a variety
547     of directions.  The sensation lasts for a few moments, and you
547     quickly return to normal.
548     The bottle of oil burns brightly giving off a surprising
548     amount of heat.
549     The rod has a note which says "WARNING -- EXPLOSIVE -- KEEP AWAY FROM
549     FIRE OR FLAME".
550     None of the torches are within reach.
551     After taking a bite from the mushroom, you feel yourself growing
551     larger, right up to the window on the tower.  From here you can
551     see into a little room which must have been a lookout for the
551     dwarves.  Unfortunately, as a giant, you can hardly fit through
551     a four-inch hole, and you soon shrink back to your normal size.
552     As you push the button on the belt, your speed decreases sharply
552     and you begin to float to the bottom of the chasm.
553     The oil in the bottle refuses to ignite.  A wick might help.
554     The flame melts the leading nicely and frees the glass.
555     The oil is exhausted and the bottle goes out.
556     The floor begins to shake violently as if a herd of elephants
556     just walked by.  As it does so, the seemingly solid rock wall
556     crumbles away, revealing another room just beyond.  The wall
556     was most likely worn thin by an ancient watercourse which dried
556     up just before completely wearing away the rock.
557     The floor of the chamber shakes briefly as if a herd of elephants
557     just walked by, but nothing else seems to happen.
558     The chest has the following words scrawled on the side: "MAZE - GRFTM"
559     As you step off the slab, the end you were standing on rises
559     quickly into the air, throwing you slightly off balance.
560     As you reach a point not far from the east end of the slab, its
560     balance shifts slightly and the entire slab teeters on some unseen
560     fulcrum.  As it shifts, you lose your footing and slide along to
560     the end of the descending platform.
561     As you jump onto the slab, your weight affects the balance and
561     the slab sinks to the floor of the chamber.
562     As you utter the last syllable, the balance of the slab changes
562     and it shifts quickly to a new position.
563     As you utter the final syllable of the spell, the balance of
563     the slab changes and it comes crashing down toward you.
564     You see a wide fissure crossing a large room, spanned by a
564     bridge of sparkling crystal.
565     You see the vision of a large volcano and have the impression of
565     great heat radiating from the crystal ball.  Suddenly, the vision
565     changes and you see a tall elven queen who smiles before you.
566     You see the image of a huge green fierce dragon in the swirling
566     mist of the ball, facing an unarmed adventurer.  The image dissolves
566     and is replaced by that of a vanquished dragon lying to the side.
567     You see a vision of a large throne carved into the rock face of a
567     chamber.  Suddenly, the throne turns around into the wall before you.
568     You see a vision of a boat on a large lake near a tiny door.
569     You see a vision of the bottom of a deep canyon, where the body of
569     once fearsome wumpus lies smashed against the rock.
570     You see the image of oil burning in a bottle, and you feel the warmth
570     of the flame even through the crystal ball.
571     Before you, there is the image of an adventurer floating slowly
571     through space and landing gently on the floor of a chasm.
572     You see a vision of a kingly individual, richly adorned, drawing a
572     sword out of a stone.
573     Before you, there is a vision of a large rock formation towering
573     up from the floor of the room.  Suddenly, the rock splits in two
573     and you catch a glimpse of an armory beyond.
574     Before you is a vision of an immense repository for the Adventure
574     game, filled with various objects from the game.  The vision moves
574     quickly through various rooms and chambers, but the image is too
574     dark to get any detail.  Finally, there is an image of sunlight
574     and a group of cheering elves who carry you forward out of the cave.
575     The crystal ball clouds over and the vision fades.
576     The crystal ball rolls easily across the floor and, fortunately,
576     does not seem too fragile.
577     The crystal ball is worth a full twenty-five points, but it also
577     has a magical air about it.
578     As you set the ball down on the slab, it rolls quickly away down
578     the slope.  As it hits the water, there is considerable thrashing
578     and you hear some creature scurry happily away with its treasure.
579     As you approach the pool, an arm reaches out of the water and
579     drags you quickly beneath the surface.  Although your assailant
579     is slight and wiry, he has amazing strength and you are unable
579     to escape his grasp.  Fortunately, the creature seems less
579     interested in you than in your belongings, and you feel its arms
579     searching through all your possessions.  Suddenly, as if it found
579     what it wanted, it releases you and runs quickly back up the
579     slab.  Weary from the struggle, you crawl back to the shore.
580     The weight is negligible.
581     That's too heavy to carry.
582     Suddenly, out of nowhere, there is a blinding flash just above
582     your head.  As you recover your sight, you see a ghostlike figure
582     surrounded by an ever-shifting glow.  In a sepulchral voice, the
582     figure speaks: "You have found the last treasure in Adventure and
582     are nearly set to join the ranks of the Master Adventurers.  You
582     have thirty turns to tidy up your affairs; after that, meet me at
582     the Devil's Chair."  The figure vanishes as quickly as it
582     appeared.
583     Once again, out of nowhere, the blinding light appear and you are
583     pushed back towards the chair.  The ghostly figure appears and
583     catches your gaze.  With a commanding presence he intones: "Sit."
583     Driven by his will, you have no other choice and find yourself
583     sitting back on the rock seat.
584     The letter reads:
585     The letter vanishes in a puff of smoke.
586     Before you have a chance to figure out what to do, you hear wild
586     splashing noises in the water beside you.  An emaciated creature
586     of some unfamiliar description jumps from the pool and screams
586     "Mine!  It's mine!".  He snatches the crystal ball and runs
586     quickly up the slab to the cavern on the far side.
587     The brass bar is octagonal in shape and approximately one foot
587     long.  One end is hollow, but the other is capped with a solid
587     brass ball.  Along the edge of the bar are inscribed the words
587     "What seest thou else in the dark backward and abysm of time?"
587     -- Shakespeare
588     The crystal box is set firmly in the rock.
589     There is no obvious way to open the box.  There might be an opening
589     on the bottom, but that part is firmly encased in the rock.
590     This place is an incredible mess.  There's just no way to find
590     anything specific in here.
591     The opening of the vial is too small to put anything in.
592     From up close, it looks like nothing so much as an outlandish
592     phone booth, although it appears to be a machine of some sort.
592     It is about five feet tall and four feet in diameter.  You are
592     facing the only opening, and it is just large enough for you to
592     go inside.
593     The bar fits snugly over the lever base.  Just as the attachment
593     is complete, an array of sparks fly from the base to the lever
593     and weld the two firmly together.
594     As you move the lever, a whirring sound begins to rise from the
594     machine.  Through the glass, you can see the laboratory get
594     strangely dim, then disappear altogether.  The whirring sound
594     intensifies and you have a sense of great speed.  Suddenly,
594     everything is quiet.
595     Once again, you hear the whirring sound rise from somewhere deep
595     in the machine.  The laboratory fades and the dials begin to
595     spin quickly through time.  For a moment, you have the sense of
595     extreme speed which excites your entire spirit, and then . . .
596     The south end of the laboratory is occupied by the machine,
596     but it looks like you might be able to get inside it.
597     You are still in the laboratory, but it is very different now.
597     The journals are gone, and in their place you can see some huge
597     leather-bound tomes, some of which look quite ancient.  The
597     entire room is cluttered with a variety of vials, tubes, powders
597     and beakers.  It is still a mess.  The only uncluttered surface
597     is a large carved oak table.  One of the books lies open on it
597     next to some vial of greenish liquid.  Next to the table is a
597     squarish rock about three feet high.
597     <NL>
597     You only have a few moments to look around before the door
597     opens and a wizard walks in.  He strides over to the table,
597     muttering to himself.  His long flowing white hair and beard
597     are slightly mussed, and his floor-length robe (covered with
597     stars, moons and comets) is looking tired.  Under his arm, he
597     is carrying an open crystal box and in his other hand is a
597     ruby diadem.  Glancing at the book, he puts the diadem inside
597     the box and sets it on the squarish rock, upon which you now
597     notice the freshly-carved letters "Y2".
597     <NL>
597     The wizard's back is turned to you, and he seems too preoccupied
597     to notice you at all.  You see him open the vial of green liquid
597     and pour half of it onto the ground near the rock.  He steps
597     back and solemnly intones:
597     <NL>
598     Cleave to rock without desisting
598     Time and ages pass away
598     Yield not unto those insisting
598     Guard the prize against the day
598     <NL>
598     One will come to claim the treasure
598     One with heart both brave and true
598     One whose right is beyond measure
598     One will give the sign anew
598     <NL>
598     Neither spell nor chant nor rhyme
598     Wizard's might nor dullard's brawl
598     Mar the lock before 'tis time
598     Ere the one has said the all
598     <NL>
598     MSYBA!
599     <NL>
599     The green fluid begins to smoke.  Soon the box, rock and wizard
599     are enshrouded in a thick green mist.  A loud retort echoes
599     through the chamber on the heels of a blinding flash.  Out of
599     the mist, you hear the words:
599     <NL>
599     "Woe to whomsoever dares reverse my spell..."
599     <NL>
599     When the mist clears, the wizard, rock and treasure have all
599     vanished, leaving much of the lab completely empty except for
599     a small green object.
599     <NL>
600     The liquid begins to smoke and you are quickly surrounded
600     by a greenish fog.  After another bright flash and loud
600     bang, the smoke slowly clears, showing the crystal box
600     resting free on its pedestal.
601     There is no particularly effective way to do that.  Maybe
601     you should try pouring it.

1       A large cloud of green smoke appears in front of you.  It clears away
1       to reveal the Enchanter, clothed in grey.  He fixes you with a steely
1       glare and declares, "This adventure has lasted too long."  With that
1       he makes a single pass over you with his hands, and everything around
1       you fades away into a grey nothingness.
2       Even wizards have to wait longer than that!
3       I'm terribly sorry, but Colossal Cave is closed.  Our hours are:
4       Only wizards are permitted within the cave right now.
5       We do allow visitors to make short explorations during our off hours.
5       Would you like to do that?
6       Colossal Cave is open to regular adventurers at the following hours:
7       Very well.
8       Only a wizard may continue an adventure this soon.
9       I suggest you resume your adventure at a later time.
10      Do you wish to see the hours?
11      Do you wish to change the hours?
12      New magic word (null to leave unchanged):
13      New magic number (null to leave unchanged):
14      Do you wish to change the message of the day?
15      Okay.  You can save this version now.
16      Are you a wizard?
17      Prove it!  Say the magic word!
18      That is not what I thought it was.  Do you know what I thought it was?
19      Oh dear, you really *ARE* a wizard!  Sorry to have bothered you . . .
20      Foo, you are nothing but a charlatan!
21      New hours specified by defining "Prime Time".  Give only the hour
21      (e.g. 14, Not 14:00 or 2pm).  Enter a negative number after last pair.
22      New hours for Colossal Cave:
23      Limit each line to 70 chars.  End with a blank line.
24      Line too long, retype:
25      Not enough room for another line.  Ending message here.
26      Do you wish to (re)schedule the next holiday?
27      To begin how many days from today?
28      To last how many days (zero if no holiday)?
29      To be called what (up to 20 characters)?
30      Too small!  Assuming minimum value (45 minutes).
31      Break out of this and save your core-image.
32      You can save the game in your directory by typing:
32      "SAVE yourname"  to the Monitor.
32      When you want to restart, type "RUN yourname".  Later!
33      Do you need a new map?
