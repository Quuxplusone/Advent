1       You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.
1       Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows out of the building and
1       down a gully.
2       You have walked up a hill, still in the forest.  The road slopes back
2       down the other side of the hill.  There is a building in the distance.
3       You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring.  Off
3       to one side is a small storeroom.
4       You are in a valley in the forest beside a stream tumbling along a
4       rocky bed.
5       You are in open forest, with a deep valley to one side.  Not far
5       off is a large billboard.
6       You are in open forest near both a valley and a road.
7       At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a 2-inch slit
7       in the rock.  Downstream the streambed is bare rock.
8       You are in a 20-foot depression floored with bare dirt.  Set into the
8       dirt is a strong steel grate mounted in concrete.  A dry streambed
8       leads into the depression.
9       You are in a small chamber beneath a 3x3 steel grate to the surface.
9       A low crawl over cobbles leads inward to the west.
10      You are crawling over cobbles in a low passage.  There is a dim light
10      at the east end of the passage.
11      You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the surface.
11      A low wide passage with cobbles becomes plugged with mud and debris
11      here, but an awkward canyon leads upward and west.  A note on the wall
11      says "Magic Word XYZZY".
12      You are in an awkward sloping east/west canyon.
13      You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet high.  The walls are frozen
13      rivers of orange stone.  An awkward canyon and a good passage exit
13      from east and west sides of the chamber.
14      At your feet is a small pit breathing traces of white mist.  An east
14      passage ends here except for a small crack leading on.
15      You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of sight to
15      the west.  There are openings to either side.  Nearby, a wide stone
15      staircase leads downward.  The hall is filled with wisps of white mist
15      swaying to and fro almost as if alive.  A cold wind blows up the
15      staircase.  There is a passage at the top of a dome behind you.
16      The crack is far too small for you to follow.
17      You are on the east bank of a fissure slicing clear across the hall.
17      The mist is quite thick here, and the fissure is too wide to jump.
18      This is a low room with a crude note on the wall.  The note says,
18      "You won't get it up the steps".
19      You are in the Hall of the Mountain King, with passages off in all
19      directions.
20      You are at the bottom of the pit with a broken neck.
21      You didn't make it.
22      The dome is unclimbable.
23      You are at the west end of the Twopit Room.  There is a large hole in
23      the wall above the pit at this end of the room.
24      You are at the bottom of the eastern pit in the Twopit Room.  There is
24      a small pool of oil in one corner of the pit.
25      You are at the bottom of the western pit in the Twopit Room.  There is
25      a large hole in the wall about 25 feet above you.
26      You clamber up the plant and scurry through the hole at the top.
27      You are on the west side of the fissure in the Hall of Mists.
28      You are in a low N/S passage at a hole in the floor.  The hole goes
28      down to an E/W passage.
29      You are in the South Side Chamber.
30      You are in the West Side Chamber of the Hall of the Mountain King.
30      A passage continues west and up here.
31      >$<
32      You can't get by the snake.
33      You are in a large room, with a passage to the south, a passage to the
33      west, and a wall of broken rock to the east.  There is a large "Y2" on
33      a rock in the room's center.
34      You are in a jumble of rock, with cracks everywhere.
35      You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of
35      sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below.  Traces of
35      white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the right.
35      Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that
35      someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and
35      25 feet away there is a similar window looking into a lighted room.  A
35      shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.
36      You are in a dirty broken passage.  To the east is a crawl.  To the
36      west is a large passage.  Above you is a hole to another passage.
37      You are on the brink of a small clean climbable pit.  A crawl leads
37      west.
38      You are in the bottom of a small pit with a little stream, which
38      enters and exits through tiny slits.
39      You are in a large room full of dusty rocks.  There is a big hole in
39      the floor.  There are cracks everywhere, and a passage leading east.
40      You have crawled through a very low wide passage parallel to and north
40      of the Hall of Mists.
41      You are at the west end of Hall of Mists.  A low wide crawl continues
41      west and another goes north.  To the south is a little passage 6 feet
41      off the floor.
42      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
43      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.

55      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
56      Dead end.
57      You are on the brink of a thirty foot pit with a massive orange column
57      down one wall.  You could climb down here but you could not get back
57      up.  The maze continues at this level.
58      Dead end.
59      You have crawled through a very low wide passage parallel to and north
59      of the Hall of Mists.
60      You are at the east end of a very long hall apparently without side
60      chambers.  In the south wall are several wide cracks and a high
60      hole, but the hole is far above your head.  To the east a wide
60      crawl slants up.  To the north a round two foot hole slants down.
61      You are at the west end of a very long featureless hall.  The hall
61      joins up with a narrow north/south passage.
62      You are at a crossover of a high N/S passage and a low E/W one.
63      Dead end.
64      You are at a complex junction.  A low hands and knees passage from the
64      north joins a higher crawl from the east to make a walking passage
64      going west.  There is also a large room above.  The air is damp here.
65      You are in Bedquilt, a long east/west passage with holes everywhere.
65      To explore at random select north, south, up, or down.
66      You are in a room whose walls resemble swiss cheese.  Obvious passages
66      go west, east, NE, and NW.  Part of the room is occupied by a large
66      bedrock block.
67      You are at the east end of the Twopit Room.  The floor here is
67      littered with thin rock slabs, which make it easy to descend the pits.
67      There is a path here bypassing the pits to connect passages from east
67      and west.  There are holes all over, but the only big one is on the
67      wall directly over the west pit where you can't get to it.
68      You are in a large low circular chamber whose floor is an immense slab
68      fallen from the ceiling (Slab Room).  East and west there once were
68      large passages, but they are now filled with boulders.  Low small
68      passages go north and south, and the south one quickly bends west
68      around the boulders.
69      You are in a secret N/S canyon above a large room.
70      You are in a secret N/S canyon above a sizable passage.
71      You are in a secret canyon at a junction of three canyons, bearing
71      north, south, and SE.  The north one is as tall as the other two
71      combined.
72      You are in a large low room.  Crawls lead north, NE, and SW.
73      Dead end crawl.
74      You are in a secret canyon which here runs E/W.  It crosses over a
74      very tight canyon 15 feet below.  If you go down you may not be able
74      to get back up.
75      You are at a wide place in a very tight N/S canyon.
76      The canyon here becomes too tight to go further south.
77      You are in a tall E/W canyon.  A low tight crawl goes 3 feet north and
77      seems to open up.
78      The canyon runs into a mass of boulders -- dead end.
79      The stream flows out through a pair of 1 foot diameter sewer pipes.
79      It would be advisable to use the exit.
80      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
81      Dead end.
82      Dead end.
83      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
84      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
85      Dead end.
86      Dead end.
87      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
88      You are in a long, narrow corridor stretching out of sight to the
88      west.  At the eastern end is a hole through which you can see a
88      profusion of leaves.
89      There is nothing here to climb.  Use "up" or "out" to leave the pit.
90      You have climbed up the plant and out of the pit.
91      You are at the top of a steep incline above a large room.  You could
91      climb down here, but you would not be able to climb up.  There is a
91      passage leading back to the north.
92      You are in the Giant Room.  The ceiling here is too high up for your
92      lamp to show it.  Cavernous passages lead east, north, and south.  On
92      the west wall is scrawled the inscription, "FEE FIE FOE FOO" [sic].
93      The passage here is blocked by a recent cave-in.
94      You are at one end of an immense north/south passage.
95      You are in a magnificent cavern with a rushing stream, which cascades
95      over a sparkling waterfall into a roaring whirlpool which disappears
95      through a hole in the floor.  Passages exit to the south and west.
96      You are in the Soft Room.  The walls are covered with heavy curtains,
96      the floor with a thick pile carpet.  Moss covers the ceiling.
97      This is the Oriental Room.  Ancient oriental cave drawings cover the
97      walls.  A gently sloping passage leads upward to the north, another
97      passage leads SE, and a hands and knees crawl leads east.
98      You are following a wide path around the outer edge of a large cavern.
98      Far below, through a heavy white mist, strange splashing noises can be
98      heard.  The mist rises up through a fissure in the ceiling.  The path
98      hugs the cavern's rim to the NE and south, while another branch forks
98      west.  A round chute with extremely smooth walls angles sharply up
98      to the southwest.
99      You are in an alcove.  A small NW path seems to widen after a short
99      distance.  An extremely tight tunnel leads east.  It looks like a very
99      tight squeeze.  An eerie light can be seen at the other end.
100     You're in a small chamber lit by an eerie green light.  An extremely
100     narrow tunnel exits to the west, and a dark corridor leads NE.
101     You're in the Dark-Room.  A corridor leading south is the only exit.
102     You are in an arched hall.  A coral passage once continued up and east
102     from here, but is now blocked by debris.  The air smells of sea water.
103     You're in a large room carved out of sedimentary rock.  The floor and
103     walls are littered with bits of shells imbedded in the stone.  A
103     shallow passage proceeds downward, and a somewhat steeper one leads
103     up.  A low hands and knees passage enters from the south.
104     You are in a long sloping corridor with ragged sharp walls.
105     You are in a cul-de-sac about eight feet across.
106     You are in an anteroom leading to a large passage to the east.  Small
106     passages go west and up.  The remnants of recent digging are evident.
106     A sign in midair here says "Cave under construction beyond this point.
106     Proceed at own risk.  [Witt Construction Company]".
107     You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all different.
108     You are at Witt's End.  Passages lead off in *ALL* directions.
109     You are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across.  The floor is
109     covered by white mist seeping in from the north.  The walls extend
109     upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspended from some unseen point far
109     above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and
109     midway between the canyon walls.  (The mirror is obviously provided
109     for the use of the dwarves, who as you know, are extremely vain.)  A
109     small window can be seen in either wall, some fifty feet up.
110     You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of
110     sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below.  Traces of
110     white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the left.
110     Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that
110     someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and
110     25 feet away there is a similar window looking into a lighted room.  A
110     shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.
111     A large stalactite extends from the roof and almost reaches the floor
111     below.  You could climb down it, and jump from it to the floor, but
111     having done so you would be unable to reach it to climb back up.
112     You are in a little maze of twisting passages, all different.
113     You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir.  An opaque cloud
113     of white mist fills the room and rises rapidly upward.  The lake is
113     fed by a stream, which tumbles out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet
113     overhead and splashes noisily into the water somewhere within the
113     mist.  The indistinct shape of the opposite shore can be dimly seen
113     through the mist.  The only passage goes back toward the south.
114     Dead end.
115     You are at the northeast end of an immense room, even larger than the
115     Giant Room.  It appears to be a repository for the "ADVENTURE"
115     program.  Massive torches far overhead bathe the room with smokey
115     yellow light.  Scattered about you can be seen a pile of bottles (all
115     of them empty), a nursery of young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed
115     of oysters, a bundle of black rods with rusty stars on their ends, and
115     a collection of brass lanterns.  Off to one side a great many dwarves
115     are sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly.  A sign nearby reads: "Do
115     not disturb the dwarves!"  An immense mirror is hanging against one
115     wall, and stretches to the other end of the room, where various other
115     sundry objects can be glimpsed dimly in the distance.  An unoccupied
115     telephone booth stands against the north wall.
116     You are at the southwest end of the repository.  To one side is a pit
116     full of fierce green snakes.  On the other side is a row of small
116     wicker cages, each of which contains a little sulking bird.  In one
116     corner is a bundle of black rods with rusty marks on their ends.  A
116     large number of velvet pillows are scattered about on the floor.
116     Beside one of the pillows is a large, dusty, leather-bound volume
116     with the title "History of Adventure" embossed in pure gold.  A
116     vast mirror stretches off to the northeast, almost reaching the
116     phone booth.  At your feet is a large steel grate, next to which is
116     a sign which reads, "Treasure Vault. Keys in Main Office."
117     You are on one side of a large, deep chasm.  A heavy white mist rising
117     up from below obscures all view of the far side.  A SW path leads away
117     from the chasm into a winding corridor.
118     You are in a long winding corridor sloping out of sight in both
118     directions.
119     You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
120     You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
121     You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
122     You are on the northeast side of a deep chasm.  A NE path leads
122     away from the chasm on this side.  A very narrow path hugging
122     the rim of the chasm falls off almost vertically to the west.
123     You're in a long east/west corridor.  A faint rumbling noise can be
123     heard in the distance.
124     The path forks here.  The left fork leads northeast.  A dull rumbling
124     seems to get louder in that direction.  The right fork leads southeast
124     down a gentle slope.  The main corridor enters from the west.
125     The walls are quite warm here.  From the north can be heard a steady
125     roar, so loud that the entire cave seems to be trembling.  Another
125     passage leads south, and a low crawl goes east.
126     You are on the edge of a breath-taking view.  Far below you is an
126     active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging
126     out, cascading back down into the depths.  The glowing rock fills the
126     farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving every-
126     thing an eerie, macabre appearance.  The air is filled with flickering
126     sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to
126     the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other
126     sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted
126     formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky
126     light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep
126     gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to
126     have been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire
126     crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the
126     gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.  To
126     the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously
126     from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles
126     ominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its
126     own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the already
126     hellish scene.  A dark, foreboding passage exits to the south.
127     You are in a small chamber filled with large boulders.  The walls are
127     very warm, causing the air in the room to be almost stifling from the
127     heat.  The only exit is a crawl heading west, through which is coming
127     a low rumbling.
128     You are walking along a gently sloping north/south passage lined with
128     oddly shaped limestone formations.
129     You are standing at the entrance to a large, barren room.  A sign
129     posted above the entrance reads:  "Caution!  Bear in room!"
130     You are inside a barren room.  The center of the room is completely
130     empty except for some dust.  Marks in the dust lead away toward the
130     far end of the room.  The only exit is the way you came in.
131     You are in a maze of twisting little passages, all different.
132     You are in a little maze of twisty passages, all different.
133     You are in a twisting maze of little passages, all different.
134     You are in a twisting little maze of passages, all different.
135     You are in a twisty little maze of passages, all different.
136     You are in a twisty maze of little passages, all different.
137     You are in a little twisty maze of passages, all different.
138     You are in a maze of little twisting passages, all different.
139     You are in a maze of little twisty passages, all different.
140     Dead end.
141     You are on a narrow promontory at the foot of a waterfall, which
141     spurts from an overhead hole in the rock wall and splashes into a
141     large reservoir, sending up clouds of mist and spray.
141     There is a narrow chimney on the east side of the promontory.
141     Through the thick white mist looms a polished marble slab, to
141     which is affixed an enormous rusty iron anvil.  In golden letters
141     are written the words: "Whoso Pulleth Out This Sword of This
141     Stone and Anvil, is Rightwise King-Born of All This Mountain."
142     You are on a narrow shelf above and east of the top of a very steep
142     chimney.  A long smooth granite slide curves down out of sight
142     to the east.  If you go down the slide, you may not be able to
142     climb back up.
143     You are in the private chamber of the Mountain King.  Hewn into the
143     solid rock of the east wall of the chamber is an intricately-wrought
143     throne of elven design.  There is an exit to the west.
144     You are on the east side of the throne room.  On the arm of the throne
144     has been hung a sign which reads "Gone for the day: visiting
144     sick snake. --M.K."
145     You are dragged down, down, into the depths of the whirlpool.
145     Just as you can no longer hold your breath, you are shot out over
145     a waterfall into the shallow end of a large reservoir.  Gasping
145     and sputtering, you crawl weakly towards the shore....
146     You are in dense forest, with a hill to one side.  The trees appear
146     to thin out towards the north and east.
147     You are at the high point of a wide grassy knoll, partially surrounded
147     by dense forest.  The land rises to the south and east, and drops off
147     sharply to the north and west.  The air smells of sea water.
148     You are at the edge of a trackless salt marsh.  Tall reeds obscure
148     the view.  In the mud is the partial word "-RO--O".  The missing
148     letters have been washed away by the tide.
149     You're in salt marsh.
150     You're in salty marsh.
151     You are in salt marsh.
152     Dead end.
153     You're on a sandy beach at the edge of the open sea.  The beach
153     stretches out of sight to the south.  To the north, the beach ends
153     in cliffs and blackened shoals.
154     You are at a jumble of large broken rocks and blackened shoals.
154     A gentle path leads up to the top of the nearby cliffs.  A narrow
154     treacherous path disappears among the rocks at the foot of the cliff.
155     You are on a high cliff overlooking the sea.  Far below the
155     rolling breakers smash into a jumble of blackened shoals.
155     The thunder of the surf is deafening.
156     You're at the bottom of the cliff, smashed to a lifeless pulp by the
156     pounding surf.
157     You are at Thunder Hole, a funnel shaped cavern opening onto the sea.
157     The noise of the surf pounding against the outer rocks of the cave is
157     amplified by the peculiar shape of the cave, causing a thunder-like
157     booming sound to reverberate throughout the cave.  Outside, a narrow
157     path leads south towards some large rocks.
158     You are at the top of some arched steps.  On one side is a blank wall
158     with a tiny door at the base and a shelf overhead.  On the other side
158     a westward passage leads to the sea.
159     You are in a low cramped chamber at the back of a small cave.
159     There is a shelf in the rock wall at about the height of your
159     shoulder.
160     You are on a wide ledge, bounded on one side by a rock wall,
160     and on the other by a sheer cliff.  The only way past is through
160     a large wrought-iron door.
161     You feel dizzy...Everything around you is spinning, expanding,
161     growing larger....  Dear me!  Is the cave bigger or are you smaller?
162     You are again overcome by a sickening vertigo, but this time
162     everything around you is shrinking...Shrinking...
163     You are again overcome by a sickening vertigo, but this time
163     everything is shrinking... I mean, you are growing.  This is
163     terribly confusing!
164     You feel dizzy...Everything around you is spinning, expanding,
164     growing larger....
165     You're at the bottom of the cliff with a broken neck.
166     You are at the western tip of the Blue Grotto.  A large lake almost
166     covers the cavern floor, except for where you are standing.  Small
166     holes high in the rock wall to the east admit a dim light.  The
166     reflection of the light from the water suffuses the cavern with
166     a hazy bluish glow.
167     You are on the western shore of an underground sea.  The way
167     west is through a wrought-iron door.
168     You are on the eastern shore of the Blue Grotto.  An ascending
168     tunnel disappears into the darkness to the SE.
169     You are at a high rock on the NE side of a watery chamber at the mouth
169     of a small brook.  An unknown gas bubbles up through the water from
169     the chamber floor.  A bluish light can be seen to the southwest.
170     You are in a windy tunnel between two large rooms.
171     You are in the Bat Cave.  The ceiling and tops of the walls are
171     covered with sleeping bats.  The floor is buried by a mass of dry,
171     foul-smelling guano.  The stench is overpowering.  Exits to the NW
171     and east.
172     You are in a very tight N/S crack.  The passage seems to widen to
172     the south.
173     You are in a very tight N/S crack.  The passage south is blocked
173     by a recent cave-in.
174     You're in the Cloakroom.  This is where the dreaded Wumpus repairs
174     to sleep off heavy meals.  (Adventurers are his favorite dinner!)
174     Two very narrow passages exit NW and NE.
175     You're in a room containing several small climbable pits.  Passages
175     exit to the east and north.
176     You are at the bottom of a small featureless pit.
177     You are at a high hole in a rock wall.
178     The NE passage is blocked by a recent cave-in.
179     You are in a sloping muddy defile, next to a tumbling brook.
180     You are in a level E/W passage partially blocked by an overhanging
180     tongue of rock.  A steep scramble would take you up over the tongue,
180     whence continues an upward crawl.  There is a small hole in the
180     north wall of the passage.
181     The dog won't let you pass.
182     You're in the Upper Passage, a long level E/W tunnel.
183     You are in a star-shaped chamber.  Passages exit north, east, south,
183     and west.
184     You are at an elbow in a winding E/W passage.
185     Dead end.
186     You're at the intersection of two long tunnels.  One goes NW,
186     the other NE.
187     You're in a long narrow east-west passage which curves out of sight
187     at both ends.
188     You're in the Rotunda.  Corridors radiate in all directions.
188     There is a telephone booth standing against the north wall.
189     You are standing in a telephone booth at the side of a large chamber.
189     Hung on the wall is a banged-up pay telephone of ancient design.
190     You're at the Devil's Chair, a large crystallization shaped like a
190     seat, at the edge of a black abyss.  You can't see the bottom.
190     An upward path leads away from the abyss.
191     You're in a dead-end crack.
192     You're on a small gravel beach at the south wall of the Blue Grotto.
192     A gravelly path leads east.
193     You are in the Apiary.  The walls are covered with colorful,
193     intricate, flower-like patterns of crystallized gypsum.
194     You are at the end of a short E/W corridor.
195     You are looking west from the end of a short E/W corridor.  At your
195     feet is a pile of loose rubble.  On your left is a hole into another
195     chamber.
196     You are in an arched hall.  The remnants of a now-plugged coral
196     passage lie to the east.  The north wall has partially crumbled,
196     exposing a large connecting hole to another room.
197     You're in the Vestibule, a short passageway between two rooms.
198     You are in the Fairy Grotto.  All around you innumerable stalactites,
198     arranged in immense colonnades, form elegant arches.  On every side
198     you hear the dripping of water, like the footsteps of a thousand
198     fairies.  A small stream runs from the SW corner.  A bright glow
198     emanates from the south side of the grotto, and a steep passage
198     descends to the east.
199     You have approached the lower end of a steep passage, but it is
199     just too cold here to hang around, and you aren't properly equipped
199     to continue.  With teeth chattering, you climb back up....
200     You are in the Crystal Palace.  An overhead vein of phosphorescent
200     quartz casts a luminous glow which is reflected by countless chips of
200     mica embedded in both walls, which consist of some sort of highly
200     reflective glass, apparently of volcanic origin.  A winding path
200     of yellow sandstone leads west and rises steeply to the east.
201     You are following a yellow sandstone path.  There is a glow
201     to the west.
202     You are in a very tall chamber whose walls are comprised of many
202     different rock strata.  Layers of red and yellow sandstone
202     intertwine with bright bands of calcareous limestone in a rainbow-
202     like profusion of color.  The rainbow effect is so real, you
202     are almost tempted to look for a pot of gold!  Poised far over
202     your head, a gigantic slab, wedged tightly between the north and
202     south walls, forms a natural bridge across the roof of the chamber.
203     You're in a steeply sloping passage.  It is very cold here.
204     You are in the Hall of Ice, in the deepest part of the caverns.
204     During winter, frigid outside air settles here, making this room
204     extremely cold all year round.  The walls and ceilings are covered
204     with a thick coating of ice.  An upward passage exits to the west.
205     You are standing on a natural bridge far above the floor of a circular
205     chamber whose walls are a rainbow of multi-colored rock.  The bridge
205     was formed eons ago by a huge slab which fell from the ceiling and
205     is now jammed between the north and south walls of the chamber.
206     You are in a low, wide room below another chamber.  A small green
206     pond fills the center of the room.  The lake is apparently spring-
206     fed.  There is a narrow passage to the north.
206     A larger passage continues west.
207     You are in a tight north/south crawl through a stratum of red
207     colored rock.  The air is damp with mist.
208     You are in a tall canyon on the south side of a swift, wide river.
208     Written in the mud in crude letters are the words: "You Have Found
208     Lost River."  A wide path leads west along the bank.  A tight
208     crawlway would take you out of the canyon.
209     You are standing on a large flat rock table at the western end of
209     Lost River Canyon.  Beneath your feet, the river disappears amidst
209     foam and spray into a large sinkhole.  A gentle path leads east
209     along the river's south shore.  Another leads sharply upward along
209     the river's north side.
210     You are at a niche in the canyon wall, far above a raging river.
210     The air is filled with mist and spray, making it difficult to see
210     ahead.  An E/W sloping ledge hugging the canyon's rim narrows to
210     the east.  A wide crack in the canyon wall leads north and
210     quickly bends around to the left.
211     You are on a narrow and treacherous ledge, which rises
211     almost vertically to the east.
212     You are standing in a telephone booth at the side of the Repository.
213     You're at the east end of a level passage at a hole in the floor.
214     You're at the north edge of a dark cove.
215     You are in a dry granite basin, worn smooth eons ago by water
215     swirling down from a now-dry spillway.
216     You're in a dry spillway east of and above a smooth rock basin.
217     You are in the Winery, a cool dark room which extends some
217     distance off to the east.
218     You are to the east of the Winery, where the room ends in a thicket
218     of high, sharp, pointed, climbable limestone pinnacles.  There is a
218     narrow ledge just above the top of the spires.  If you go up, it
218     might be difficult to get back down.
219     You are in a high-vaulted cavern whose roof rises over fifty
219     meters to culminate in a series of pointed arches directly over
219     your head.  There are also two low arches to either side, forming
219     side portals.  The whole effect is that of a gothic cathedral.
220     You're at the east portal of the Gothic Cathedral.
221     You're at the west portal of the Gothic Cathedral.
222     You are at the foot of the Altar, an immense, broad stalagmite.
223     You're on top of an enormous, broad stalagmite.  There is a hole
223     in the ceiling overhead.
224     You are in a room the size and shape of a small crypt.  A narrow
224     cut exits east.  There is a hole in the floor.
225     You are in the Gothic Chapel, a small chamber adjoining the Gothic
225     Cathedral.
226     You are on the floor of the Rainbow Room.  In fact, you are spread
226     *ALL OVER* the floor of the Rainbow Room.
227     You are in a dimly lit passage behind Thunder Hole.  Etched into
227     the rock wall are the ominous words:
227     >$<
227             You are approaching the River Styx.
227             Lasciate Ogni Speranza Voi Ch'Entrate.
227     >$<
228     You are at the River Styx, a narrow little stream cutting directly
228     across the passageway.  The edge of the stream is littered with sticks
228     and other debris washed in by a recent rainfall.  On the far side
228     of the river, the passage continues east.
229     You're on the east side of the river's sticks.
230     You are on a ledge at the northern end of a long N/S crawl.  The
230     ledge is above a large number of sharp vertical limestone spires.
230     An attempt to climb down could be dangerous, if you get my *point*!
231     You are very neatly skewered on the point of a sharp rock.
232     You have poled your boat across the calm water.
233     You have poled your boat across the dark water.
234     You have poled your boat across the Blue Grotto.
235     You're at Dante's Rest, on the north side of a yawning dark chasm.
235     A passage continues west along the chasm's edge.
236     You are at the east end of a riverbank path in Lost River Canyon.
237     The staircase is now unclimbable.
238     You're in the caretaker's storeroom.
239     You are in many small pieces at the bottom of a deep chasm.
240     You are standing behind a large billboard on a ridge above a deep
240     valley.  To the north, the forest gives way to dense swamp and
240     then to open flatlands.  Far beyond, the land rises sharply towards
240     the impassible Misty Mountains.  Nestled at the base of a distant
240     cliff are the stone turrets of a tall white castle.
241     You are in hilly forest, but northward the land flattens out
241     and grows swampy.  To the south and east is a heavily wooded
241     ridge of low hills.
242     You're at the edge of a great forest.  To the north lies dark,
242     ominous swampland.
243     Dense swamp surrounds you.  Dim sunlight filters through the
243     foliage; all directions look alike.
244     You are in a dark, murky swamp.  However, the deep foliage
244     appears to thin out towards the south and southwest.  There
244     is a faint smell of brackish salt water in the air.
245     You are at the edge of an open area of wet sand.  The dense
245     foliage appears to grow thinner towards the northeast.  A small
245     sign stuck in the muck reads: "Site of Proposed Municipal Parking
245     Lot -- D.M. Witt, Contractor."
246     You've wandered into a quicksand pit and drowned.
247     You are in an open area near the edge of the swamp.  The ground
247     near you appears to have been paved with concrete.
248     You're in an open field on the south side of a deep ravine.  South
248     and west the land is an almost impassible swamp.  To the west the
248     ravine merges with the swamp; some distance to the east it ends
248     abruptly at the foot of a sheer granite cliff.  A dry drainage pipe
248     six inches in diameter emerges from the base of the cliff just
248     above the floor of the ravine.
249     The bramblebush is too thick and thorny to penetrate.
250     You are in a dull N/S passage beside a tall black rock.  On the rock
250     is chisled the outline of a four-leafed clover, under which is the
250     inscription: "Notice: This rock fabricated from ersatz materials."
251     You are beside a deep, water-filled moat, in front of a great stone
251     castle.
252     You are at the foot of a towering cliff.  The sheer rock face is
252     partially obscured by thick vines growing up the cliff.
253     You are on a ledge about halfway up the cliff.  The upper part of
253     the cliff seems unclimbable.
254     You are beside an old dry well in the East Courtyard of a great
254     castle built against the southern face of an unscalable granite
254     cliff.  On your left an impregnable wall of gleaming white stone
254     encompasses the entire court and castle in a half-moon shaped curve
254     which meets the cliff at either end.  To your right, across the
254     steeply rising courtyard, is Lords' Keep, the heart of the castle.
255     You're at the bottom of a dry wellshaft.  Every bone in your
255     body is broken.
256     You are at the bottom of a vertical shaft, apparently a dry well,
256     whose cylindrical wall is lined with smooth stone.  Far above your
256     head, you can see daylight!
257     You are at a sharp bend in a very narrow defile between two sheer
257     rock walls.  The defile curves out of sight to the NW and SW.
258     You are in an open field north of a deep ravine.  The ravine
258     terminates at the base of a towering N/S cliff.  A narrow crack
258     in the base of the cliff leads east.
259     You're in a large chamber.  All around are massive skeletons of
259     long-dead members of the order proboscidea ungulata, who evidently
259     used this room as their final resting place.  Passages exit
259     north and south.
260     You are at the bottom of the ravine with a broken head.
261     You are in a short tunnel north of a large room.
262     You are on top of a flat black rock.
263     You are at the entrance to Lords' Keep.
264     You are at the base of the central portion of the courtyard near
264     what appears to be some sort of large wooden door in the stone wall.
264     Attached to the wall is a heavy winch.
265     You are in the West Courtyard, a wide flat area bounded on the north
265     by a high cliff and on the south and west by the curve of the castle
265     wall.
266     You have no way of crossing the moat.
267     You are at the foot of a great cliff.  The moat and castle
267     wall are built flush up against the side of the cliff.  A
267     portion of the cliff's face is obscured by hanging vines.
268     You are in the lair of Ralph the Giant Centipede.  The air reeks
268     with the stench of rotting bits of flesh.  Giant centipedes, in
268     general, are not partial to visitors.
269     You are inside Lords' Keep, at the south end of the Great Hall.
269     The room is lit by smokey torches hung high overhead.  Several
269     passages lead off to connecting rooms.
270     You are in the Aviary, where in days long gone the Royal
270     Falconer kept and trained the King's hunting hawks.
271     The short hallway ends at a heavy steel door inlaid with enamelled
271     tiles, each of which is a different color.  The tiles, nine in all,
271     are arranged in a 3x3 grid, thusly:
271     >$<
271     I--------------------------------------I
271     I    Red     I   Silver   I  Fuschia   I
271     I------------I------------I------------I
271     I    Gold    I    Dun     I   White    I
271     I------------I------------I------------I
271     I   Orange   I   Nacre    I   Black    I
271     I--------------------------------------I
271     >$<
272     You are inside a large steel vault.
273     You are at the foot of a wide ascending staircase at the north
273     end of the Great Hall.  On either side of the staircase, hallways
273     continue north at this level.
274     You are in a long north/south hallway on the west side of the
274     castle.  A short westerly passage leads to an apparent dead end.
275     You are in the Conservatory, whence the gnomes often repair to
275     relax with a little music.  On one side of the room is an old
275     upright piano.
276     You're in a flat circular clearing surrounded by dense forest.
277     You are in a gloomy north/south hallway on the east side of the
277     castle.  An entrance in the west wall leads to a small sunlit room.
278     >$<         (TRANSITION INTO COPTER.)
279     As you move to enter the aircraft, the Orcs block your way.
279     Their leader won't let you board without a letter of transit.
280     After inspecting your letter of transit, the Orcs sullenly stand
280     aside to let you board the aircraft.
281     You are in the helicopter's cramped passenger cabin.  The only
281     visible feature is a silver button on the wall.
282     >$<         (TRANSITION FROM COPTER [1].)
283     >$<         (TRANSITION FROM COPTER [2].)
284     You're on the south end of a high narrow ridge, which is bounded
284     on its east side by a high mountain.  Dug into the mountainside is
284     a ramshackle old mine entrance.  The ridge drops off to the west
284     in a rocky cliff.  You might be able to climb down the cliff, but
284     you probably won't be able to get back up.
285     You are in a gloomy tunnel, the entrance to a long-abandoned mine.
285     All around is fallen rock and rotted timbers.  To your left, a
285     small room adjoins the main tunnel.
286     You are on a narrow N/S ridge high above a stone wall and wide moat.
287     You are at the northwest end of a narrow ridge high above the
287     castle's inner courtyard.
288     You are in an idyllic garden hidden in an inner courtyard of,
288     and surrounded on three sides by, the Castle Keep.  The far end
288     of the garden is bounded by a high cliff.
289     You are in a small room off the east hallway.  Through a heavily
289     barred window you can look out on a lovely secret garden.
290     You have leapt from a great hight into the moat, and drowned.
291     You have jumped from a great hight into a lovely garden which is
291     now your graveyard.
292     After a few seconds in freefall your parachute opens with a sudden
292     "Pop!"  Several moments later you land unhurt.  The magic 'chute
292     then folds itself back into the knapsack.
293     You're in an open field on the south side of a flooded ravine.
293     South and west the land merges into nearly impassible swamp.  In
293     the muck is a fresh footprint!  Incredibly, it looks very
293     much like that of a Giant Devonian Rat, long thought extinct.
294     You are in an open field north of a flooded ravine.  The ravine
294     terminates at the base of a towering N/S cliff.  A narrow crack
294     in the base of the cliff leads east.  A footprint, possibly that of
294     a Giant Devonian Rat, is outlined in the mud.
295     You are at the east end of a steep ravine, near where a drainage
295     pipe emerges from a rock wall.
296     You are at the western end of the ravine's floor.  The ground ahead
296     looks wet and treacherous.
297     You have stumbled into a quicksand patch and drowned.
298     You are in the engineering room.  On a control panel on the wall
298     are four buttons, colored green, brown, red and yellow; and a
298     digital gauge.
299     You are in a very steeply angled tunnel.
300     You are at the bottom of the mine's main shaft.  Several passages,
300     now all blocked by cave-ins, used to lead off in all directions.
300     To the north, the one remaining tunnel is partially blocked.
301     You are in a dead-end shaft formerly used for temporary storage.

2000    definitely harbors no goodwill towards you.
3000    The angry arthropod is definitely gaining on you.  You had

6000    You have raised the bridge just in time.  The centipede stamps

1       Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in
1       treasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never
1       seen again.  Magic is said to work in the cave.  I will be your eyes
1       and hands.  Direct me with natural English commands and I will tell
1       you where you are and describe what is happening around you.  My
1       normal language is Fnordish, so if I don't always understand what
1       you tell me, be patient and try to say the same thing some other way.
1       - - - -
1       (If this is your first trip to ADVENTURE-Land, you should type
1       "HELP" to get some general instructions.)
1       Good Luck!

2       A little dwarf with a big knife blocks your way.
3       A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you, threw a little
3       axe at you which missed, cursed, and ran away.
4       There is a threatening little dwarf in the room with you!
5       One sharp nasty knife is thrown at you!
6       None of them hit you!
7       One of them gets you!
8       A hollow voice says "Plugh".
9       There is no way to go that direction.
10      I am unsure how you are facing.  Use compass points or nearby objects.
11      I don't know in from out here.  Use compass points or name something
11      in the general direction you want to go.
12      I don't know how to apply that word here.
13      I don't understand that!
14      I'm game.  Would you care to explain how?
15      Sorry, but I am not allowed to give more detail.  I will repeat the
15      long description of your location.
16      It is now pitch dark.  If you proceed you will likely fall into a pit.
17      If you prefer, simply type "W" rather than "West".
18      Are you trying to catch the bird?
19      If you want to snatch the birdy's bod,
19      You'd better hide that nasty rod.
20      Are you trying to somehow deal with the snake?
21      That nasty snake means to stay;
21      You'll need a friend's help to chase her away.
22      Do you really want to quit now?
23      You fell into a pit and broke every bone in your body!
24      You are already carrying it!
25      You can't be serious!
26      The bird was unafraid when you entered, but as you approach it becomes
26      disturbed and you cannot catch it.
27      You can catch the bird, but you cannot carry it.
28      There is nothing here with a lock!
29      You aren't carrying it!
30      The little bird attacks the green snake, and in an astounding flurry
30      drives the snake away.
31      You have no keys!
32      It has no lock.
33      I don't know how to lock or unlock such a thing.
34      It was already locked.
35      Are you kidding?  You'd break every tooth in your mouth!
36      The label on the bag reads: "Mix with care.  Property of
36      Witt Construction Company".
37      It was already unlocked.
38      You have no source of light.
39      Your lamp is now on.
40      Your lamp is now off.
41      There is no way to get past the bear to unlock the chain, which is
41      probably just as well.
42      Nothing happens.
43      Where?
44      There is nothing here to attack.
45      The little bird is now dead.  Its body disappears.
46      Attacking the snake both doesn't work and is very dangerous.
47      You killed a little dwarf.
48      You attack a little dwarf, but he dodges out of the way.
49      With what?  Your bare hands?
50      Good try, but that is an old worn-out magic word.
51      Welcome.    In ADVENTURE you are invited to exercise your intelligence
51      and imagination in the attempt to explore and master Colossal Cave and
51      its environs.
51      >$<
51      You can "move" from place to place by typing in various motion  verbs,
51      such as FOREST, BUILDING, DOWNSTREAM, ENTER, EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH,
51      UP,  or  DOWN.   As you move from place to place, I will describe your
51      surroundings.  The first time you enter a place, I'll give you a  full
51      description,  but,  just to move things along, I'll give you a shorter
51      description when (if) you return.
51      >$<
51      To speed the game you can sometimes move long distances with a  single
51      word.  For example, "BUILDING" (or "B", for short) usually gets you to
51      the  building  from anywhere above ground except when lost or near the
51      castle.  Also, note that cave passages turn a lot, and that leaving  a
51      room to the north does not guarantee entering the next from the south.
51      You'd best make yourself a map as you go along.
51      >$<
51      I  know  about a number of special objects, like a BLACK ROD hidden in
51      the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using action words that  I
51      know.   Examples of action verbs are TAKE, DROP, OPEN, DRINK, READ and
51      so forth.  To manipulate objects, type normal  declarative  sentences.
51      For example, if you wanted to pick up the black rod and insert it into
51      a sack you could type:
51      >$<
51          TAKE BLACK ROD AND PUT IT INTO THE SACK
51          PICK UP SACK AND CLOSE IT
51      >$<
51      Use  of  some  objects  may  have  side effects; for instance, the ROD
51      scares the BIRD.  Usually people trying unsuccessfully  to  manipulate
51      an  object are attempting something beyond their (or my!) capabilities
51      and should try a completely different tack.
51      >$<
51      As you progress through the  cave,  you  may  find  objects  of  value
51      (treasures).  Each treasure has a point value associated with it.  Its
51      value is roughly proportional to the degree of difficulty of obtaining
51      it.    To get full credit for a treasure, you must have left it safely
51      in the building, though you get partial credit just for  locating  it.
51      Note  that  leaving treasures *safely* in the building may be trickier
51      than you think!
51      >$<
51      You lose points for getting killed, or for asking  for  hints,  though
51      the  former  costs  you more.  There are also points based on how much
51      (if any) of the cave you've managed to explore; in  particular,  there
51      is  a  large bonus just for getting in (to distinguish the dilletantes
51      from the rest of the pack), and there  are  other  ways  to  determine
51      whether you've been through some of the more harrowing sections.
51      >$<
51      If you think you've found all the treasures, just keep exploring for a
51      while.    If  nothing  interesting happens, you haven't found them all
51      yet.  If something interesting *DOES* happen, it means you're  getting
51      a  bonus  and  have  an  opportunity to garner many more points in the
51      Master's Section.  I may occasionally offer hints if you  seem  to  be
51      having  trouble.    If I do, I'll warn you in advance how much it will
51      affect your score to accept the hints.
51      >$<
51      A word about my understanding of English -- I will try very hard to do
51      whatever you say, but here  are  a  few  suggestions.    To  scarf  up
51      everything movable at a given location, say 'TAKE EVERYTHING' or 'TAKE
51      ALL'.    Some  objects may be differentiated only by some attribute or
51      other.  For example, if you  were  holding  both  a  red  and  a  blue
51      frammitz,  you  would  have to distinguish between them by typing 'RED
51      FRAMMITZ' or 'BLUE FRAMMITZ' so that I'll know  which  one  you  mean.
51      Also,  you  can  specify several actions or objects by using commas or
51      'AND', as 'TAKE ABC,DEF AND XYZ AND BURN WITCH'.
51      >$<
51      The following commands will help you to play the game:
51      >$<
51      BRIEF           To save paper, you may type the command "BRIEF", which
51                      tells me never to repeat the  full  description  of  a
51                      place unless you explicitly ask me to.
51      >$<
51      DIAGNOSE        In  addition  to getting yourself killed, you can also
51                      be wounded or injured in  various  (non-lethal)  ways.
51                      If  you get burnt, poisoned, electrocuted or whatever,
51                      you can check on  your  current  state  of  health  by
51                      typing 'HEALTH' or 'DIAGNOSE'.  Note that recuperation
51                      takes place faster outside in the fresh air!
51      >$<
51      EXAMINE         A  general verb for inspecting objects, e.g., "EXAMINE
51                      FRAMMITZ".  Will often give useful  information  about
51                      the specified object.  More specific operations can be
51                      performed with the verb "LOOK", described below.
51      >$<
51      GRIPE           If  you  think  you have run into a program bug, or if
51                      you have any ideas for extensions to  the  cave,  type
51                      "GRIPE"  or  "REPORT" and then enter as long a message
51                      as you like.  This will be immediately transmitted  to
51                      the Wizard, who will try to reply within a day or two.
51      >$<
51      HOURS           To  see  what  hours  the  cave  is normally open, say

51                      pause in mid-game, a small disk file, named by you, is
51                      created  which  holds  all  the  variable  information
51                      pertinent  to  your game.  Prudent players should save
51                      their games  prior  to  attempting  new  or  dangerous
51                      challenges.

51      Best Game       To encourage competition amongst the hackers, a  minor
51                      new  feature  has been added to the game.  At startup,
51                      the best game since some base date will be  displayed.
51                      "Best  game"  is  that  game having the combination of
51                      highest score and lowest number of turns.  A new  game
51                      having  a  score  higher  than  the  current best game

52      It misses!
53      It gets you!
54      Ok
55      You can't unlock the keys.
56      You have crawled around in some little holes and wound up back in the
56      main passage.
57      I don't know where the cave is, but hereabouts no stream can run on
57      the surface for long.  I would try the stream.
58      I need more detailed instructions to do that.
59      I can only tell you what you see as you move about and manipulate
59      things.  I cannot tell you where remote things are.
60      I can't make any sense out of that.
61      What?
62      Are you trying to get into the cave?
63      The grate is set in solid rock;
63      You'll need some keys to pick that lock.
64      The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple, with an
64      occasional grove of pine or spruce.  There is quite a bit of under-
64      growth, largely birch and ash saplings plus nondescript bushes of
64      various sorts.  This time of year visibility is quite restricted by
64      all the leaves, but travel is quite easy if you detour around the
64      spruce and berry bushes.
65      Welcome to ADVENTURE!!  Would you like instructions?
66      Digging without a shovel is quite impractical.  Even with a shovel
66      progress is unlikely.
67      Blasting requires dynamite.
68      I'm as confused as you are.
69      Mist is a white vapor, usually water, seen from time to time in
69      caverns.  It can be found anywhere but is frequently a sign of a deep
69      pit leading down to water.
70      Your feet are now wet.
71      I think I just lost my appetite.
72      Thank you, it was delicious!
73      You have taken a drink from the clear water.  The water tastes
73      strongly of minerals, but is not unpleasant.  It is extremely cold.
74      The bottle is now empty.
75      Rubbing the electric lamp is not particularly rewarding.  Anyway,
75      nothing exciting happens.
76      Peculiar.  Nothing unexpected happens.
77      Your bottle is empty and the ground is wet.
78      The ground here is not suitable for digging.
79      Watch it!
80      Which way?
81      Oh dear, you seem to have gotten yourself killed.  I might be able to
81      help you out, but I've never really done this before.  Do you want me
81      to try to reincarnate you?
82      All right.  But don't blame me if something goes wr......
82      *                    --- POOF!! ---                    *
82      You are engulfed in a cloud of orange smoke.  Coughing and gasping,
82      you emerge from the smoke and find....
83      You clumsy oaf, you've done it again!  I don't know how long I can
83      keep this up.  Do you want me to try reincarnating you again?
84      Okay, now where did I put my orange smoke?....  >POOF!<
84      Everything disappears in a dense cloud of orange smoke.
85      Now you've really done it!  I'm out of orange smoke!  You don't expect
85      me to do a decent reincarnation without any orange smoke, do you?
86      Okay, if you're so smart, do it yourself!  I'm leaving!
90      >>> Messages 81 thru 90 are reserved for "Obituaries". <<<
91      Sorry, but I no longer seem to remember how it was you got here.
92      It's too heavy.  You'll have to drop something first.
93      You can't go through a locked steel grate!
94      I believe what you want is right here with you.
95      You don't fit through a two-inch slit!
96      I respectfully suggest you go across the bridge instead of jumping.
97      There is no way across the fissure.
98      You're not carrying anything.
99      You are currently holding the following:
100     It's not hungry (it's merely pinin' for the fjords).  Besides, you
100     have no bird seed.
101     The snake has now devoured your bird.
102     There's nothing here it wants to eat (except perhaps you).
103     You fool, dwarves eat only coal!  Now you've made him *REALLY* mad!!
104     Your cask is empty and the ground is soaked.
105     You aren't carrying them!
106     I don't need to, thank you.
107     The ground is wet and the air is smelly.
108     Your lamp is now on, but the glare from the walls is absolutely
108     blinding.  If you proceed you are likely to fall into a pit.
109     The vines are extremely tough and deeply rooted into the cliff wall.
109     And they wouldn't be good for much anyway.
110     Don't be ridiculous!
111     The door is extremely rusty and refuses to open.
112     The plant indignantly shakes dry its leaves and asks, "Water?"
113     The hinges are quite thoroughly rusted now and won't budge.
114     The oil has freed up the hinges so that the door will now move,
114     although it requires some effort.
115     The plant has exceptionally deep roots and cannot be pulled free.
116     The dwarves' knives vanish as they strike the walls of the cave.
117     Something you're carrying won't fit through the tunnel with you.
117     You'd best take inventory and drop something.
118     You can't fit this five-foot clam through that little passage!
119     You can't fit this five-foot oyster through that little passage!
120     I advise you to put down the clam before opening it.  >Strain!<
121     I advise you to put down the oyster before opening it.  >Wrench!<
122     You don't have anything strong enough to open the clam.
123     You don't have anything strong enough to open the oyster.
124     A glistening pearl falls out of the clam and rolls away.  Goodness,
124     this must really be an oyster.  (I never was very good at identifying
124     bivalves.)  Whatever it is, it has now snapped shut again.
125     The oyster creaks open, revealing nothing but oyster inside.  It
125     promptly snaps shut again.
126     You have crawled around in some little holes and found your way
126     blocked by a recent cave-in.  You are now back in the main passage.
127     There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.
128     Out from the shadows behind you pounces a bearded pirate!  "Har, har,"
128     he chortles, "I'll just take all this booty and hide it away with me
128     chest deep in the maze!"  He snatches your treasure and vanishes into
128     the gloom.
129     A sepulchral voice reverberating through the cave, says, "Cave closing
129     soon.  All adventurers exit immediately through Main Office."
130     A mysterious recorded voice groans into life and announces:
130        "This exit is closed.  Please leave via Main Office."
131     It looks as though you're dead.  Well, seeing as how it's so close to
131     closing time anyway, I think we'll just call it a day.
132     The sepulchral voice entones, "The cave is now closed."  As the echoes
132     fade, there is a blinding flash of light (and a small puff of orange
132     smoke). . . .    As your eyes refocus, you look around and find...
133     There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
133     wall, burying the dwarves in the rubble.  You march through the hole
133     and find yourself in the Main Office, where a cheering band of
133     friendly elves carry the conquering adventurer off into the sunset.
134     There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
134     wall, burying the snakes in the rubble.  A river of molten lava pours
134     in through the hole, destroying everything in its path, including you!
135     There is a loud explosion, and you are suddenly splashed across the
135     walls of the room.
136     The resulting ruckus has awakened the dwarves.  There are now several
136     threatening little dwarves in the room with you!  Most of them throw
136     knives at you!  All of them get you!
137     Oh, leave the poor unhappy bird alone.
138     I daresay whatever you want is around here somewhere.
139     I'm not sure what you mean by "Stop".  Use "Quit" if you want to give
139     up.
140     You can't get there from here.
141     You are being followed by a very large, tame bear.
142                *** THE HISTORY OF ADVENTURE (ABRIDGED) ***
142                            By:  W. I. Zerd, F.R.C.W.
142     >$<
142     ADVENTURE was originally developed by William Crowther, and later
142     substantially rewritten and expanded by Don Woods at Stanford Univ.
142     According to legend, Crowther's original version was modelled on an
142     a real cavern, called Colossal Cave, which is a part of Kentucky's
142     Mammoth Caverns.  That version of the game included the main maze
142     and a portion of the third-level (Complex Junction - Bedquilt -
142     Swiss Cheese rooms, etc.), but not much more.
142     >$<
142     Don Woods and some others at Stanford later rewrote portions of
142     the original program, and greatly expanded the cave.  That version
142     of the game is recognizable by the maximum score of 350 points.
142     >$<
142     The latest additions were done throughout 1978-80 by David Long
142     at the University of Chicago, Graduate School of Business.
142     Long's additions include the seaside entrance and all of
142     the cave on the "far side" of Lost River (Rainbow Rm - Crystal
142     Palace - Blue Grotto - Rotunda - beyond Joshua's wall, etc., etc.).
142     The surface has also been greatly increased to include a much
142     more varied landscape containing swamp, marsh, seashore and
142     meadowland areas.  Most recent additions include the great Castle of
142     Aldor, the Elephants' Burial Ground, Leprechaun Rock and more.
142     The current cave is more than double the size of the Woods model,
142     and moreover the puzzles and treasures are somewhat more "dense",
142     (and more difficult!) in the current version.  During the expansion
142     process, the code was almost entirely rewritten to permit more
142     generalized handling of objects and to interpret a more complex
142     natural English syntax.
142     >$<
142     Except for a couple of trivial subroutines (to get user-ID's for
142     logging purposes), ADVENTURE is written entirely in FORTRAN.  This
142     not because Crowther/Woods/Long love FORTRAN, but because it is
142     almost infinitely portable.  There were indeed moments when it took
142     great strength to withstand the temptation to whip out some character
142     handling routine in MACRO, instead of the furshlugginer compiler.
142     For example, there is an excellent rival game to Adventure, called
142     DUNGEON, developed at M.I.T., which is totally non-portable since
142     it is coded in an obscure variant of two initially obscure compilers,
142     and can only be transported in executable form between DEC-10's
142     and 20's.
142     >$<
142     Thanks are owed to Roger Matus and David Feldman, both of U. of C.,
142     for several suggestions, including the Rainbow Room, the telephone
142     booth and the fearsome Wumpus.  Further thanks go to J. R. Carlson,
142     Bob Silverman and John Rager for many debugging suggestions.
142     Most thanks (and apologies) go to Thomas Malory, Charles Dodgson,
142     the Grimm Brothers, Dante, Homer, Frank Baum and especially Anon.,
142     the real authors of ADVENTURE.

143     Do you indeed wish to quit now?
144     There is nothing here with which to fill the vase.
145     The sudden change in temperature has delicately shattered the vase.
146     It is beyond your power to do that.
147     I don't know how.
148     It is too far up for you to reach.
149     You killed a little dwarf.  The body vanishes in a cloud of greasy
149     black smoke.
150     The shell is very strong and is impervious to attack.
151     What's the matter, can't you read?  Now you'd best start over.
152     The axe bounces harmlessly off the dragon's thick scales.
153     The dragon looks rather nasty.  You'd best not try to get by.
154     The little bird attacks the green dragon, and in an astounding flurry
154     gets burnt to a cinder.  The ashes blow away.
155     On what?
156     Okay, from now on I'll only describe a place in full the first time
156     you come to it.  To get the full description, say "LOOK".
157     Trolls are close relatives with the rocks and have skin as tough as
157     that of a rhinoceros.  The troll fends off your blows effortlessly.
158     The troll deftly catches the axe, examines it carefully, and tosses it
158     back, declaring, "Good workmanship, but it's not valuable enough."
159     The troll catches your treasure and scurries away out of sight.
160     The troll refuses to let you cross.
161     There is no longer any way across the chasm.
162     Just as you reach the other side, the bridge buckles beneath the
162     weight of the bear, which was still following you around.  You
162     scrabble desperately for support, but as the bridge collapses you
162     stumble back and fall into the chasm.
163     The bear lumbers toward the troll, who lets out a startled shriek and
163     scurries away.  The bear soon gives up the pursuit and wanders back.
164     The axe misses and lands near the bear where you can't get at it.
165     With what?  Your bare hands?  Against *HIS* bear hands??
166     The bear is confused; he only wants to be your friend.
167     For crying out loud, the poor thing is already dead!
168     The bear eagerly licks up the honeycomb, after which he seems to calm
168     down considerably and even becomes rather friendly.
169     The bear is still chained to the wall.
170     The chain is still locked.
171     The ravine is too deep to cross, but you might be able to climb down
171     into it on this side.  The ravine wall is extremely steep, however.
172     How?  Through solid rock?
173     There is nothing here to which the chain can be locked.
174     There is nothing here to eat.
175     Do you want the hint?
176     Do you need help getting out of the maze?
177     If you try dropping some of your pelf,
177     You may find your long lost self.
178     Are you trying to explore beyond the Plover Room?
179     Why not indeed explore that way?
179     For if you do, it'll surely pay.
179     And why, too, should I offer a clue? --
179     I have better things to do!
180     Do you need help getting out of here?
181     T'would be best
181     To avoid going West.
182     Gluttony is not one of the troll's vices.  Avarice, however, is.
183     Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best start wrapping this up, unless
183     you can find some fresh batteries.  I seem to recall there's a vending
183     machine in the maze.  Bring some coins with you.
184     Your lamp has run out of power.
185     A sudden draft has extinguished your match.
186     There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.  As you
186     turn toward them, the beam of your lamp falls across a bearded pirate.
186     He is carrying a large chest.  "Shiver me timbers!", he cries, "I've
186     been spotted!  I'd best hie meself off to the maze to hide me chest!"
186     With that, he vanishes into the gloom.
187     Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best replace those batteries.
188     Your lamp is now shining with renewed strength.
189     Your lamp is getting dim, and you haven't any more coins.  You'd
189     best start wrapping this up.
190     I'm afraid the magazine is written in dwarvish.
191     "This is not the maze where the pirate leaves his treasure chest."
192     Hmmm, this looks like a clue, which means it'll cost you 10 points to
192     read it.  Should I go ahead and read it anyway?
193     It says,
193     "Something about this place is new,
193     Although it may appear old to you.
193     If you really want to win,
193     I'm afraid you'll have to make a din."
194     It says the same thing it did before.
195     I'm afraid I don't understand.
196     "Congratulations on bringing light into the dark-room!"
197     You strike the mirror a resounding blow, whereupon it shatters into a
197     myriad tiny fragments.
198     You have taken the vase and hurled it delicately to the ground.
199     You prod the nearest dwarf, who wakes up grumpily, takes one look at
199     you, curses, and grabs for his axe.
200     Is this acceptable?
201     There's no point in suspending a demonstration game.
202     You managed to climb about halfway up before losing your hold and
202     sliding back.
203     You were only a few yards from the top when you slipped and tumbled
203     all the way back down.
204     Ok, ok.  No need to be grabby.
205     Pulling an angry bear around is a good way to get your arm ripped off.
206     The sword is now very clean.
207     The sword is now covered with oil.
208     The handle is now too slippery to grasp.
209     You have no scabbard!
210     You are already wearing it!
211     Do you want to extract the sword from the anvil?
212     The sword will all your efforts foil
212     Until you gain a stature royal.
213     Are you trying to go up the slide?
214     You can slide and you can slip,
214     But there's an easier way to make the trip.
215     You grasp the sword's handle and pull, but the sword won't budge.
215     Do you want to try yanking it out?
216     A tiny little man dressed all in green runs straight at you, shouts
216     "Phuce!", aims a kick squarely at your kneecap, misses, and
216     disappears into the forest.
217     You can't swim.  You'd best go by boat.
218     The boat's oars were stolen by the dwarves to play bing-bong.
218     (That's dwarvish ping-pong -- with rocks!).  You have no way
218     to propel the boat.
219     You are still in the boat.  It is too heavy to carry.
220     You had better leave the boat first.
221     You are now sitting in a small boat.
222     You couldn't possibly cross this sea without a large ship.
223     The cliff is unscalable.
224     Your keys are all too large for the lock.
225     The wall is too smooth to climb.
226     The shelf is beyond your reach.
227     You are already wearing them!
228     You thought maybe it was mescaline??  You feel a little dizzy,
228     but nothing happens.
229     You are growing taller, expanding like a telescope!  Just before
229     your head strikes the top of the chamber, the mysterious process
229     stops as suddenly as it began.
230     You are closing up like an accordion....shrinking..shrinking.  You
230     are now your normal size.
231     You have smashed your bottle all over the ground.
232     You are now too big to leave the way you came in.
233     This little door was built for elves,
233     Who don't blab secrets outside themselves.
233     >$<
233           - or -      (a bonus clue!)
233     >$<
233     If you're taller,
233     You'll have to get smaller.
234     Parting the vines reveals a narrow crack in the face of the cliff.
235     Sounds good.  Are you in training to be the pied piper, or what?
236     Are you trying to ascend the wellshaft?
237     You may be phoney or you may be sincere,
237     But only a fakir could climb from here.
238     You are blocked by a wall of solid rock.
239     >$<
240     The Wumpus looks at the food with distaste.  He looks at *YOU* with
240     relish!
241     You have jerked the cloak free of the rocks.  However, in doing
241     so you have caused a small rockslide, blocking the entrance
241     and making an unholy din.
242     The cloak is stuck tight under the rocks.  You'll probably have to
242     yank it out.
243     The Wumpus grabs the axe, stops and picks his teeth with it for a few
243     moments while looking thoughtfully at you.  When he finishes picking
243     his teeth, he eats the axe, belches, farts... and starts after
243     you again!
244     As the bridge disappears, the Wumpus scrambles frantically to reach
244     your side of the fissure.  He misses by inches, and with a horrible
244     shriek plunges to his death in the depths of the fissure!
245     You can't even hit a sleeping Wumpus!  The axe is now lying too near
245     the Wumpus for you to retrieve it.
246     The Wumpus is between you and the axe.  You can't reach it.
247     You can't fit through a six-inch door!
248     The dog easily dodges the axe, which lands beyond him where you can't
248     get at it.
249     The dog wolfs (natch) down the food and looks around hungrily for
249     more.  However, he does not appear to be any better disposed towards
249     your presence.
250     You've got to be kidding!
251     It's attached to the wall!
252     You can't put a thing into itself!
253     The gnome firmly blocks the door of the booth.  You can't enter.
254     The constant ringing has awakened the dwarves!
254     There are now several threatening little dwarves in the room with
254     you!  Most of them throw knives at you!  All of them get you!
255     The telephone is out of order.
256     The telephone is out of order and your hand is sore.
257     A couple of lead slugs drop from the coinbox.  (Gnomes are
257     notoriously cheap....)  But you've broken the phone beyond
257     all hope.
258     He wants treasure, not gab.
259     He didn't say anything!
260     It isn't a parrot.  He didn't say anything.
261     No one replies.  The line goes dead with a faint "CLICK".
262     I think you are a little confused!
263     As you move towards the phone booth, a gnome suddenly streaks
263     around the corner, jumps into the booth and rudely slams the door
263     in your face.  You can't get in.
264     He isn't hungry.
265     As the blast of the horn reverberates through the chamber, the
265     seemingly solid rock wall crumbles away, revealing another room just
265     beyond.  The wall was most likely worn thin by an ancient watercourse
265     which dried up just before completely wearing away the rock.
266     The chamber reverberates to the blast of the horn.
266     (Satchmo you ain't!)
267     The bees swarm over the fresh flowers, leaving the hive unguarded
267     and revealing a sweet honeycomb.
268     You are now out of breath.
269     It isn't ringing!
270     A hairy paw reaches out of the darkness and....
271     You don't have the correct change.
272     You go a short way down the bright passage, but the light
272     grows to blinding intensity.  You can't continue.
273     You know, if you type "BRIEF", I won't have to keep repeating these
273     long descriptions of each room.
274     Are you trying to reach the natural bridge?
275     From here to there you cannot go,
275     Seek Joshua's Wall and blow, man, blow.
276     You turkey!!!  Now you've done it!  It took some effort, but you
276     woke up the Wumpus.  He slowly opens one red eye, and then another,
276     and then one more (!!), and looks at you sleepily.  He had been
276     dreaming of a late snack.  If you don't act quickly, you'll
276     be a *late* adventurer!
277     The blast of your horn echos throughout hill and dale.
278     All you have are watercress sandwiches.  The bear is less than
278     interested.
279     You have smashed your sword to smithereens against a rock.
280     Setting yourself adrift in the boat with no way to propel it would
280     not be very smart.  Best to keep the pole.
281     You're already in it!
282     You've hit the jackpot!!  Hundreds of coins and slugs cascade from
282     the telephone's coin return slot and spill all over the floor of
282     the booth.
283     Whoops!  The floor has opened out from under you!  It seems you
283     have fallen into a bottomless pit.  As a matter of fact, you're
283     still falling!  Well, I have better things to do than wait around
283     for you to strike bottom, so let's just assume you're dead.
283     Sorry about that, Chief.
284     The telephone in the booth has begun to ring.
285     I don't understand what you are trying to do!
286     How do you propose to cross the river?
287     The air is filled with beautiful music.
288     The air fills with beautiful music.  The dog gradually becomes
288     less fierce, and after a short while he lies down by the side of
288     the cavern and falls into a deep sleep.
289     Are you trying to get past the dog?
290     The only stranger to pass this way,
290     Was held in Euridice's sway.
291     That wouldn't be wise.  It is best to let sleeping dogs lie.
292     The stream flows out of one very small crack and into another.
292     You can't go that way.
293     The river is too wide and deep to cross.
294     The glare is absolutely blinding.  If you proceed you are likely
294     to fall into a pit.
295     The hum of the bees rises to an angry buzz as you move towards
295     the hive.
296     The sticks and branches are all in a tangle and are stuck deep in
296     the mud.  You can't pull them out.
297     You're already carrying them!
298     The chalice is slightly cracked.  It won't hold any liquids.
299     The cask is now empty.
300     The wine goes right to your head.  You reel around in a drunken
300     stupor and finally pass out.  You awaken with a splitting headache,
300     and try to focus your eyes....
301     Yeeeecchhh!!
302     Your bottle is already full.
303     The cask is already full.
304     There is nothing here with which to fill the bottle.
305     There is nothing here which you would want to put into the cask.
306     Your bottle is now full of water.
307     The cask is now full of water.
308     Your bottle is now full of oil.
309     The cask is now full of oil.
310     The bottle is now full of wine.
311     The cask is now full of wine.
312     You have nothing in which to carry it.
313     You can't fill that.
314     Do you want it in the bottle or the cask?
315     Your containers are both full.
316     It's empty.
317     Hmmm, I see you have already gone through an extra set of batteries.
317     I'll get rid of the trash for you.
318     The bridge shakes as you cross.  Large hunks of clay and rock near
318     the edge break off and hurtle far down into the chasm.  Several of
318     the cracks on the bridge surface widen perceptibly.
319     The load is too much for the bridge!  With a roar, the entire
319     structure gives way, plunging you headlong into the raging river at
319     the bottom of the chasm and scattering all your holdings.  As the
319     icy waters close over your head, you flail and thrash with all your
319     might, and with your last ounce of strength pull yourself onto the
319     south bank of the river.
320     You can't get at him.  He is inside the phone booth.
321     Your lamp is already on.
322     Your lamp is already off.
323     Your lamp is again growing dim.  You'd better get some more batteries.
324     You know, you are wasting your batteries by wandering around out
324     here with your light on.
325     Out of the corner of your eye, you see a quick movement.  As
325     you turn, a creature the size of a large dog disappears into
325     some bushes.
326     Dead wumpi, as a rule, have little appetite.  Nothing happens.
327     How do you expect to feed a sleeping Wumpus?
328     You aren't holding it!
329     It won't fit!
330     The coin drops into the slot with a dull "clunk".  There is no
330     dial tone.
331     It's already there.
332     Thank you for your comments.  They will be dispatched immediately
332     via Gnome Express to the Wizard.
333     You can't squeeze past the boulder.
334     Grunt...Pant...You have pushed the boulder to one side, enough to
334     permit you to squeeze past it.
335     You can't get at it.
336     It's already open.
337     It's locked.
338     It's already closed.
339     You can't fill that.  It would leak all over the place.
340     It's not inside anything.
341     It isn't there!
342     How?
343     Taken.
344     Dropped.
345     I don't think I can.
346     Interesting.  How?
347     Huh?
348     You are in perfect health.
349     You are fit as a fiddle.
350     Only wizards can do that!
351     Are you kidding?  Do you want to suffocate the poor thing?
352     Thrown.
353     Left.
354     You can't get close enough for a clean thrust.
355     As you move in for the kill, the dwarf neatly slips a knife
355     between your ribs.
356     As you approach, the dwarf slashes out with his knife!
357     It's too dark to see anything!
358     <Pant!> <Strain!> The boulder now blocks the path again.
359     There's nothing inside.
360     It contains:
361     Sorry, that feature isn't implemented in this version of the
361     game.  You'll have to complain to the Wizard in person.
362     Hidden behind the poster is a steel safe, embedded in the wall.
363     Brushing the dust from one of the larger rocks reveals some carved
363     characters.
364     Enough dusting, already!  You're making me sneeze.
365     The safe door smoothly swings open.
366     Maybe if you rubbed your fingertips with sandpaper....
367     The safe's door clicks shut.
368     This is a combination safe.  The keys won't help.
369     I certainly can't read in this light.
370     The poster has a picture of a thin man with a long white beard.
370     He is wearing a high pointed cap embroidered with strange symbols,
370     and he is pointing a finger at you.  Below the picture are the words:

374     Ok, I'll give you the full description whenever you enter a room
374     for the first time.
375     You don't have the right key.
376     That's not strong enough to open the clam.
377     That's not strong enough to open the oyster.
378     The top of the bottle is too small.  You can't get it in.
379     There is only a small hole in one end of the cask.  You can't force
379     anything solid through the hole.

382     You are weaker than usual.  Better avoid fights.
383     You really ought to take a break.  You're in tough shape.
384     You are on the edge of collapse.  Lots of sun and fresh air will
384     speed your recovery.

391     Is it hot in here?  You are flushed and sweating.
392     You are feeling definitely peculiar, weak....
393     You're dizzy, nauseous.  You can barely stand.
394     You are really ill.  If you don't find an antidote soon, it's
394     curtains.
395     You are a walking wound.  You are very weak.  You'd better find out
395     what's wrong before it's too late.
396     Sheeesh!  What a mess!  Your hair has fallen out and your skin is
396     covered with blisters.  And not an aspirin in sight!
397     Well, you tried, but your strength is gone.  The agony is finally
397     over.

400     The ledge is too steep for the bear, who refuses to follow.
401     The path in that direction is too steep.  You can't proceed.
402     You have stumbled blindly through the trackless muck.
403     On the back of the billboard is a scrawled note:
403     >$<
403              B E   A L E R T !!    The world needs more lerts.
404     As the grey powder mixes with the bubbling quicksand, the whole
404     mixture gradually thickens to a rocklike hardness.
405     The grey powder is too fine to pick up.
406     You are standing in a knee-deep hole in the bat guano.
407     You are up to your hips in bat guano.
408     You've got bat turds hanging off your ears, wimp!  This isn't
408     getting you anywhere.  Best try somewhere else.
409     You've dug yourself into a three foot hole in the sand.
410     You're up to your waist in sand.
411     You're in a deep pit in the sand.
412     You have unearthed a delicate, multi-hued conch.
413     You can't burn that!
414     It's already burning!
415     You have nothing to light it with!
416     The match flares into flame.
417     You already have a lit match.
418     You have no more matches.
419     The axe is too small to do much good.  The thorns cut your arm.
420     Your elfin sword makes short work of the brambles.  After a few
420     minutes work, you hack a large hole through the tangle.
421     The axe disappears into the thicket.  You can't reach it.
422     The bramble bush sucks up the water and grows even thicker.
423     The dry brambles immediately catch fire and disappear in a roar
423     of flame.
424     You can't reach it.
425     I'm afraid it's a little late for that.
426     As you place the rose into the vase, the rose opens in full bloom,
426     revealing a sachet of rare perfume inside.
427     The following are being removed:
428     <Grunt!>  <Oy-Vey!>  Although the boulder moves a fraction of an inch,
428     it is too heavy for you to roll away.
429     Are you trying to get past the boulder?
430     You're just too tired to move that rock;
430     A good *hot* meal would help a lot.
431     Zam!  What a meal!  Now we're ready for anything!
432     As you approach the rock, an indistinct muttering sound arises from
432     the general area of the rock.  The only word you can hear clearly
432     is "Fnord!"
433     As you approach the rock, the little man suddenly notices your
433     shamrock.  "Well, well," says he, "you may be able to see me now,
433     but you'll never get by this place until you have vanquished one
433     much larger than I!  Fnord!"
434     As you approach the rock, the leprechaun (for indeed that is what he
434     is) notices your shamrock *and* your ring, and with a muttered curse,
434     disappears.
435     Donning the shamrock makes you aware of something you hadn't
435     noticed before....
436     Loose tobacco won't burn.
437     You can't light an empty pipe!
438     Fat chance.
439     No way!
440     Get serious, you bozo!
441     The leaflet reads:
441     >$<
441     Notice: Stairway blocked until further notice.  Upper quarters
441     of castle still under renovation.  -- Haf Witt, Foreman.
442     Through a solid wall?  Sounds pretty tricky to me...
443     Eat flowers?  Only health nuts and left-wingers do that!
444     There is an ominous rustling behind you in some nearby underbrush.
445     From a dark corner of the room a pair of feral eyes glitter
445     brightly, and then vanish silently.
446     A faint sound as of rapid breathing and a fetid stink fills the
446     air for a moment, and then, just as mysteriously as it began, it
446     vanishes.
447     [** UNUSED -- BUG **]
448     Parting the vines reveals a dim recess in the cliff wall.
449     Attacking a creature with 73 feet and hair on its teeth would
449     not be the smartest thing in the world.
450     The axe has no effect on the big bug's armor-like exoskeleton.
451     You couldn't leave well enough alone, could you?
452     You have snatched the centipede's very own security blanket!
453     The food tastes bland, but is not unpalatable.
454     The face of the card bears the embossed legend:
454     >$<

454     The back of the card is blank, except for a wide, dark-brown stripe.
455     The door is locked.
456     From behind the door there is a whirring sound and the card is
456     sucked from your hand.  A moment later, the great oaken door
456     swings open.
457     The liquid reacts oddly with the black substance covering the
457     statue of the bird.  After a few moments, the black coating
457     dissolves completely, revealing a statue of solid gold encrusted
457     with priceless gems of every description!
458     The door has no keyhole!
459     You are obviously attempting to intrude into a section of the castle
459     in which you have no business.  Faster than you can spit, a
459     trapdoor springs open beneath you, catapulting you into a deep
459     pit at the bottom of which a number of sharp, upright spikes
459     have been affixed.
460     Whoops, it's pitsville again!
461     As soon as you press the last tile, the great steel door slowly
461     swings open with an eerie silence.
462     Done.
463     The lamp is hardwired into the wall above the door.  You can't
463     get at it.
464     From somewhere behind you there is a faint chuckling, but
464     nothing else happens.
465     The thin black coating on the statue goes up in a flash, revealing
465     a statue of solid gold encrusted with priceless gems of every
465     description!
466     "North" is too ambiguous here: you can 'climb' the staircase,
466     or enter one of the N/S hallways on either side of the stairs
466     by typing 'NE' or 'NW'.
467     You are wearing:
468     Ahh, stroke them ivories!   Play it, Sam.
469     The document is written in an undecipherable script.  However,
469     it bears the official seal of the Orcan government.
470     You have no way of manipulating the winch.
471     The iron bar, evidently the winch handle, slips easily into the
471     winch mechanism.
472     The ancient coat-of-arms of the family of Aldor consists of a gold
472     fiddle-dee-dee with bronze oak leaf cluster.  Stemming from the
472     cluster are three brass spheres, under which is the family motto
472     (obviously in Latin): "IN HOC TU OFFEN".
473     The silk sheeting is tightly folded and is attached to the
473     knapsack by numerous strong cords.  You can't remove it.
474     The door slams shut as soon as you hit the button, followed by
474     the sound of the engine revving up.  After many minutes of noise
474     and vibration, the engine falls silent and the door slides open.
475     Rattle, roar, shake, etc....
476     The paper is a worthless deed to a defunct silver mine.
477     The paper is a valuable deed to a reclaimed silver mine.
478     The ledge drops off into a sheer cliff.  You can't climb down.
479     The door is tightly shut.  There is no apparent way to open it.
480     The door is locked on the outside (garden side) with a heavy
480     wooden bar.
481     The garden door is now open.
482     The garden door is now locked.
483     The bar is too heavy to carry.
484     A wimp like you would have no chance against a combat-trained
484     Orc, let alone four of them.
485     It would help if you'd insert the handle into the winch mechanism.
486     Are you trying to board the helicopter?
487     If of the Orcs you wish to be rid,
487     First you must find where the letter is hid.
487     As time goes by you're sure to find
487     What Bogey once had on his mind.
488     From somewhere in the distance comes the deep throbbing of a heavy
488     engine.
489     The sound of the engine ceases.
490     I'm no engineer, but judging by the sound, the pump engines are
490     overheating.
491     The pumps have run too long without cooling off!  From deep within
491     the mine the engine's throbbing becomes a loud vibrating roar as
491     the great engine tears itself apart.  All around you timbers are
491     cracking!  The entire roof of the mine is collapsing!
492     According to the pump sensors, the mine floor is dry.  Nothing
492     happens.
493     The bank of the ravine is so steep you'll need both hands to climb
493     out.  You can't carry anything.
494     The ravine's north bank is too steep to climb.
495     The ravine is full of water and too wide to swim.
496     The mine entrance has collapsed.  There is no way to enter.
497     The tunnel is completely flooded.  You can't proceed.
498     Opening the cabinet reveals a narrow vertical dumbwaiter shaft.
498     A pulley-mounted chain controls the movement of the dumbwaiter.
499     There isn't any way to climb down the dumbwaiter shaft.
500     The meter reads zero.
501     The meter reads "1".
502     The meter reads "2".
503     The meter reads "3".
504     The meter reads "4".
505     The meter reads "5".
506     The engine is already in operation.
507     The room lights are already on.
508     The room lights were already off.
509     The tunnel is a real squeaker.  You'll be lucky to get through
509     with your clothes on, let alone anything else.
510     The dumbwaiter slides smoothly into view.
511     The dumbwaiter slides smoothly out of sight.
512     Achoo!  Ker-snuf!  I think the dust around this place is
512     getting to me.  Why don't you clean it up a little?
513     You are enveloped in a cloud of noxious-smelling tobacco fumes.
514     The air ahead is filled with huge mosquitos, with stingers the
514     size of icepicks!  The mosquitos haven't yet caught your scent.
514     Do you really want to proceed?
515     Once the mosquitos catch your scent, it's all over very quickly.
515     Sheesh!  You have more holes in you than a pincushion!
516     Your pipe fumes have effectively fumigated your flying foes.  The
516     bothersome bugs beat it as you approach.
517     After playing the flute for a few moments, you become aware of
517     stealthy footsteps behind you.
518     You are being followed by a strangely docile giant Devonian rat!
519     A rat as large as a small pony seems to appear from nowhere.  It seems
519     entranced by the sound of your flute.
520     The big rat, entranced by the music, blindly lurches over the edge
520     of the cliff, only to be pounded to smithereens on the rocks below.
521     The dirty rat is too quick for you!  She easily dodges the blow.
522     Your foolhardy action has broken the spell of the music.  With a
522     lightning-quick move, the mammoth mouse bites you on the forearm
522     with her razor-sharp teeth, and is gone in a flash.
523     The rat bite on your arm, though not deep, is aching.
524     Your arm is aching badly.
525     The dirty rat's wound is festering badly.  The injury may be more
525     serious than you had thought.
526     Your whole arm is infected and turning black.  And the rest of you
526     doesn't feel so hot, either.
527     You are running a very high fever.  Your arm is black and swollen
527     and is hanging by a thread.   You're sinking fast.

531     The huge pill (if that's what it is) tastes awful, but seems
531     to have no adverse effects.
532     Just in time!  The contents of the huge pill quickly cure you of
532     the rat-induced infection.

534     The amulet shines with a strange blue light and then goes dark.
535     Its clasp is broken.  You can't wear it.
536     You really should keep better track of things you have found.
537     A round dial covered with numeric markings is on the door of the
537     safe.
538     Sorry, the GRIPE facility is not enabled at this time.
