       1You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.
       1Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows out of the building and 
       1down a gully. 
       2You have walked up a hill, still in the forest.  The road slopes back 
       2down the other side of the hill.  There is a building in the distance.
       3You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring. 
       4The stream flows out through a pair of 1 foot diameter sewer pipes. 
       4It would be advisable to use the exit.
       5You are in open forest, with a deep valley to one side. 
       6You are in open forest near both a valley and a road. 
       7You are in a valley in the forest beside a stream tumbling along a
       7rocky bed.
       8At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a 2-inch slit
       8in the rock.  Downstream the streambed is bare rock.
       9You are in a 20-foot depression floored with bare dirt.  Set into the 
       9dirt is a strong steel grate mounted in concrete.  A dry streambed
       9leads into the depression.  A narrow trail heads south. 
      10You are standing at the base of an enormous cliff.  A huge river is 
      10flowing over the cliff, forming a waterfall.  A rainbow can be seen 
      10above the mist and spray.  The river continues west, and a forest is
      10to the north.  A dark hole can be seen in the cliff.
      11You are on the north side of a wide river.  The river flows from east 
      11to west.  A depression is to the north. 
      12You are at a narrow beach of brilliant white sand.  the river turns 
      12north into a forest.
      13You have been pulled into a giant whirlpool --you are spinning--
      13--spinning--  
  --spinning--
      13You have been sucked under! 
      14You are on a wide curving beach.  The sand appears green due to the 
      14greenish light which is filtering up from the depths of the river.
      14There is a large roman numeral three chiseled deep into the rock wall.
      14Perhaps you have found the lost third enterance to the cave!
      14There is a dark corridor leading to the east. 
      15You are in a small chamber beneath a 3x3 steel grate to the surface.
      15A low crawl over cobbles leads inward to the west.
      16You are in a very small circular room.
      17You are in the main power chamber for the entire cave.
      17There is a passage to the north whose walls are covered with lichen.
      18You are crawling over cobbles in a low passage.  There is a dim light 
      18at the east end of the passage. 
      19You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the surface.
      19A low wide passage with cobbles becomes plugged with mud and debris 
      19here, but an awkward canyon leads upward and west.  A note on the wall
      19says "Magic Word ZZZZADV".
      20You are in an awkward sloping east/west canyon. 
      21You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet high.  The walls are frozen 
      21rivers of orange stone.  An awkward canyon and a good passage exit
      21from east and west sides of the chamber.
      22At your feet is a small pit breathing traces of white mist.  An east
      22passage ends here except for a small crack leading on.
      23The crack is far too small for you to follow. 
      24You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of sight to
      24the west.  There are openings to either side.  Nearby, a wide stone 
      24staircase leads downward.  The hall is filled with wisps of white mist
      24swaying to and fro almost as if alive.  A cold wind blows up the
      24staircase.  There is a passage at the top of a dome behind you. 
      25You are on the east bank of a fissure slicing clear across the hall.
      25The mist is quite thick here, and the fissure is too wide to jump.
      26You are on the west side of the fissure in the hall of mists. 
      27You are in  a very low wide passage parallel to and north of the
      27 hall of mists. 
      28You are at the west end of hall of mists.  A low wide crawl continues 
      28west and another goes north.  To the south is a little passage 6 feet 
      28off the floor.
      29You are at the east end of a very long hall apparently without side 
      29chambers.  To the east a low wide crawl slants up.  To the north a
      29round two foot hole slants down.
      30You are at the west end of a very long featureless hall.  The hall
      30joins up with a narrow north/south passage. 
      31You are at a crossover of a high N/S passage and a low E/W one. 
      33this is a low room with a crude note on the wall.  the note says, 
      33"You won't get it up the steps".
      34You are falling...

      36The dome is unclimbable.
      37You are in the Hall of the Mountain King, with passages off in all
      37directions. 
      38You can't get by the snake. 
      39You are in the south side chamber.
      40You are in the west side chamber of the Hall of the Mountain King.
      40A passage continues west and up here. 
      41You are in a low N/S passage at a hole in the floor.  the hole goes 
      41down to an E/W passage. 
      42You are in a large room, with a passage to the south, a passage to the
      42west, and a wall of broken rock to the east.  There is a large "Y2" on
      42a rock in the room's center.
      43You are in a jumble of rock, with cracks everywhere.
      44You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of
      44sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below.  Traces of
      44white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the right. 
      44Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that 
      44someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and 
      4425 feet away there is a similar window looking into a lighted room.  A
      44shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you. 
      45You are in a dirty broken passage.  To the east is a crawl.  To the 
      45west is a large passage.  Above you is a hole to another passage. 
      46You are on the brink of a small clean climbable pit.  A crawl leads 
      46west. 
      47You are in the bottom of a small pit with a little stream, which
      47enters and exits through tiny slits.
      48You are in a large room full of dusty rocks.  There is a big hole in
      48the floor.  There are cracks everywhere, and a passage leading east.
      49You are at a complex junction.  A low hands and knees passage from the
      49north joins a higher crawl from the east to make a walking passage
      49going west.  There is also a large room above.  The air is damp here. 
      50You are in Bedquilt, a long east/west passage with holes everywhere.
      50To explore at random select north, south, up, or down.
      51You are in an anteroom leading to a large passage to the east.  Small 
      51passages go west and up.  The remnants of recent digging are evident. 
      51A sign hanging in midair says "Cave under construction beyond this point. 
      51PROCEED AT OWN RISK.   Witt Construction Company "
      51A large pile of rocks can be seen to the south. 
      52You are in the south side of an anteroom leading to a large passage 
      52to the east.  A small passage leads west.  The remnants of recent digging 
      52are evident.  A large pile of rocks can be seen to the north. 
      52There is a large room to the south. 
      53You are at Witt's end.  Passages lead off in *all* directions.
      54You are in a large, square room. The floor is composed of huge slabs
      54of mica.  In the center of the room there is an enormous fountain.
      54it is spraying thin jets of liquid which sparkle all the colors of
      54the rainbow.  They cascade down into a wide pool at the base. 
      54You can see what appears to be an anteroom to the north.
      55You are in a secret canyon which here runs E/W.  It crosses over a
      55very tight canyon 15 feet below.  If you go down you may not be able
      55to get back up. 
      56You are at a wide place in a very tight N/S canyon. 
      57The canyon here becomes very tight, but you might be able to squeeze past.
      58You are in a tall E/W canyon.  A low tight crawl goes 3 feet north and
      58seems to open up. 
      59The canyon runs into a mass of boulders -- dead end.
      60You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east. 
      61You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east. 
      62You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east. 
      63You are in a secret n/s canyon above a large room.
      64You are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across.  The floor is 
      64covered by white mist seeping in from the north.  The walls extend
      64upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspended from some unseen point far
      64above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and
      64midway between the canyon walls.  (The mirror is obviously provided 
      64for the use of the Dwarves, who as you know, are extremely vain.)  A
      64small window can be seen in either wall, some fifty feet up.
      65You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir.  An opaque cloud
      65of white mist fills the room and rises rapidly upward.  The lake is 
      65fed by a river which gurgles quietly somewhere within the dense mist. 
      65The only apparent passage goes back toward the south. 
      65Faint silvery lines are seen on the east wall, which upon closer
      65examination, seem to be the outlines of a door set into the wall. 
      65The door seems to be surrounded by silvery scrollwork and runes.
      65
A rancid stench exudes from a gloomy area to the west.
      66With a resounding crack, the doors swing open.  You step through
      66and enter the great Dwarf works of Khazad-dum.
      66The great doors swing shut behind you.
      67The doors open before you and you step through.  The great doors swing
      67shut behind you and once more seem to blend into the rock face. 
      68You are in a dark winding passage leading upward to the southeast.
      68Mysterious passages and fissures lead off in all directions.
      69You are stumbling around in an enourmously complicated network of 
      69tunnels.
      70You have stumbled around in many dark passages, and have finally found
      70your way back to the winding passage. 
      71You are in the Chamber of Marzabul.  The tomb of Balin, Lord of Moria 
      71occupies the center of the room.  Strewn about the room are the bones 
      71and weapons of many Dwarves, apparently massacred in a great battle.
      71A small door opens to the west, and a low passage to the northeast. 
      72You are in the second hall of Moria.  A slender bridge spans a
      72north-south chasm so deep the bottom cannot be seen.
      74You are in the first hall of Moria.  A slender bridge spans a 
      74north-south chasm so deep the bottom cannot be seen.
      75You are in a room whose walls resemble swiss cheese.  Obvious passages
      75go west, east, NE, and NW.  Part of the room is occupied by a large 
      75bedrock block.
      76You are in the Soft room.  The walls are covered with heavy curtains, 
      76the floor with a thick pile carpet.  Moss covers the ceiling. 
      77You are at the east end of the Twopit room.  The floor here is
      77littered with thin rock slabs, which make it easy to descend the pits.
      77There is a path here bypassing the pits to connect passages from east 
      77and west.  There are holes all over, but the only big one is on the 
      77wall directly over the west pit where you can't get to it.
      78You are at the bottom of the eastern pit in the twopit room.  There is
      78a small pool of oil in one corner of the pit. 
      79You are at the west end of the twopit room.  There is a large hole in 
      79the wall above the pit at this end of the room. 
      80You are at the bottom of the western pit in the twopit room.  There is
      80a large hole in the wall about 25 feet above you. 
      81You are in a large low circular chamber whose floor is an immense slab
      81fallen from the ceiling (Slab room).  East and west there once were 
      81large passages, but they are now filled with boulders.  Low small 
      81passages go north and south, and the south one quickly bends west 
      81around the boulders.
      82>$< 
      83You clamber up the plant and scurry through the hole at the top.
      84You are in a long, narrow corridor stretching out of sight to the 
      84west.  At the eastern end is a hole through which you can see a 
      84profusion of leaves.
      85You are in the giant room.  The ceiling here is too high up for your
      85lamp to show it.  Cavernous passages lead east, north, and south.  On 
      85the west wall is scrawled the inscription, "Fee Fie Foe Foo"  sic . 
      86The passage here is blocked by a recent cave-in.
      87You are at one end of an immense north/south passage. 
      88You are in a magnificent cavern with a rushing stream, which cascades 
      88over a sparkling waterfall into a roaring whirlpool which disappears
      88through a hole in the floor.  Passages exit to the south and west.
      89You are at the top of a steep incline above a large room.  You could
      89climb down here, but you would not be able to climb up.  There is a 
      89passage leading back to the north.
      90You are in a very long narrow tunnel which runs northwest and southeast.
      91This is the Oriental room.  Ancient oriental cave drawings cover the
      91walls.  A gently sloping passage leads upward to the north, another 
      91passage leads SE, and a hands and knees crawl leads west. 
      92You are following a wide path around the outer edge of a large cavern.
      92Far below, through a heavy white mist, strange splashing noises can be
      92heard.  The mist rises up through a fissure in the ceiling.  The path 
      92exits to the south and west.
      93You are on a narrow ledge in a mist filled cavern.
      94You are in an alcove.  A small nw path seems to widen after a short 
      94distance.  An extremely tight tunnel leads east.  It looks like a very
      94tight squeeze.  An eerie light can be seen at the other end.
      95You're in a small chamber lit by an eerie blue light.  An extremely 
      95narrow tunnel exits to the west.  A dark corridor leads NE. 
      96You're in the Dark-room.  A corridor leading south is the only exit.
      97You are in a large low room.  Crawls lead north, SE, and SW.
      99You are in a long winding corridor sloping out of sight in both 
      99directions. 
     100You are on one side of a large, deep chasm.  A heavy white mist rising
     100up from below obscures all view of the far side.  A sw path leads away
     100from the chasm into a winding corridor. 
     101You are on the far side of the chasm.  A NE path leads away from the
     101chasm on this side. 
     102You're in a long east/west corridor.  A faint rumbling noise can be 
     102heard in the distance.
     103The path forks here.  The left fork leads northeast.  A dull rumbling 
     103seems to get louder in that direction.  The right fork leads southeast
     103down a gentle slope.  The main corridor enters from the west. 
     104The walls are quite warm here.  From the north can be heard a steady
     104roar, so loud that the entire cave seems to be trembling.  Another
     104passage leads south, and a low crawl goes east. 
     105You are in a small chamber filled with large boulders.  The walls are 
     105very warm, causing the air in the room to be almost stifling from the 
     105heat.  The only exit is a crawl heading west, through which is coming 
     105a low rumbling. 
     106You are on the edge of a breath-taking view.  Far below you is an 
     106active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging
     106out, cascading back down into the depths.  The glowing rock fills the 
     106farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving every-
     106thing an eerie, macabre appearance.  The air is filled with flickering
     106sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to 
     106the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other 
     106sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted
     106formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky
     106light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep
     106gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to
     106have been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire 
     106crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the 
     106gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.  To 
     106the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously
     106from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles 
     106ominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its 
     106own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the already 
     106hellish scene.  A dark, foreboding passage exits to the south.
     108You are walking along a gently sloping north/south passage lined with 
     108oddly shaped limestone formations.
     109You are standing at the entrance to a large, barren room.  A sign 
     109posted above the entrance reads:  "Caution!  Bear in room!" 
     110You are inside a barren room.  The center of the room is completely 
     110empty except for some dust.  Marks in the dust lead away toward the 
     110far end of the room.  The only exit is the way you came in. 
     111You are at a sharp bend in the tunnel.  The tunnel slopes 
     111downward to the west, and also runs back to the north.
     112You are on a narrow ledge on the eastern side of the fissure. 
     113You are on an uneven ledge on the western side of the fissure.
     114Dead end
     115You are at the northeast end of an immense room, even larger than the 
     115giant room.  It appears to be a repository for the "FunAdv"
     115program.  Massive torches far overhead bathe the room with smoky
     115yellow light.  Scattered about you can be seen a pile of bottles (all 
     115of them empty), a nursery of young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed
     115of oysters, a bundle of black rods with rusty stars on their ends, and
     115a collection of brass lanterns.  Off to one side a great many dwarves 
     115are sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly.  A sign nearby reads: "Do
     115NOT disturb the Dwarves!"  An immense mirror is hanging against one 
     115wall, and stretches to the other end of the room, where various other 
     115sundry objects can be glimpsed dimly in the distance. 
     116You are at the southwest end of the repository.  To one side is a pit 
     116full of fierce green snakes.  On the other side is a row of small 
     116leather sacks, each of which contains a vicious mongoose.  In one 
     116corner is a bundle of black rods with rusty marks on their ends.  A 
     116large number of velvet pillows are scattered about on the floor.  A 
     116vast mirror stretches off to the northeast.  At your feet is a large
     116steel grate, next to which is a sign which reads, "Treasure Vault.
     116Keys in Main Office." 
     117You are deep within the dark mine.
     118You are deep within the dark mine.
     119Dead end. 
     120You are deep within the dark mine.
     121You are deep within the dark mine.
     122You are deep within the dark mine.
     123Dead end. 
     124The dead end. 
     125Dead end. 
     126Dead end crawl. 
     127You are in a secret N/S canyon above a sizable passage. 
     128You are in a secret canyon at a junction of three canyons, bearing
     128north, south, and SE.  The north one is as tall as the other two
     128combined. 
     129You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of
     129sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below.  Traces of
     129white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the left.
     129Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that 
     129someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and 
     12925 feet away there is a similar window looking into a lighted room.  A
     129shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you. 
     130You are in a wide passage.  The floor is covered with a fine layer
     130of soft clay.  As you walk, your shoes stick as if to bubble gum. 
     131A large stalactite extends from the roof and almost reaches the floor 
     131below.  You could climb down it, and jump from it to the floor, but 
     131having done so you would be unable to reach it to climb back up.
     133You're in a large room carved out of sedimentary rock.  The floor and 
     133walls are littered with bits of shells imbedded in the stone.  A
     133shallow passage proceeds downward, and a somewhat steeper one leads 
     133up.  A low hands and knees passage enters from the south. 
     134You are in a long sloping corridor with ragged sharp walls. 
     135You are in a cul-de-sac about eight feet across.
     136You are in an arched hall.  A coral passage once continued up and east
     136from here, but is now blocked by debris.  The air smells of salt spray. 
     137With some difficulty, you manage to squeeze past the debris.
     138You are in an ancient and beautiful coral passage, which has been 
     138built up over the years by millions of tiny sea creatures.
     138To the north lies a drab passage, to the west the passage is partially
     138blocked by debris.  The air smells strongly of salt spray.
     139You are in a dingy, dark, dank room with a small drab passage to the
     139south, and a dark corridor to the west. 
     140You are walking along a drab passage, when without warning you
     140turn a corner, and are confronted by unimaginable beauty. 
     141You are at a sudden bend in a tunnel upon whose every surface there 
     141grows a thick coating of lichen.  There is a vast torchlit hall to
     141the east, and a dim tunnel to the south.
     142You are in a vast hall whose ceiling is supported by immense wooden 
     142posts which recede to the limits of your vision.  Massive torches 
     142far overhead bathe the room with smoky yellow light.  You stare in
     142awe, incapable of conceiving the forces which must have created this
     142ancient hall.  There is a tunnel lined with lichen to the west. 
     142The hall continues out of sight to the east, and grows brighter.
     143You are in a vast hall whose ceiling is supported by immense crystalline
     143trusses which recede to the limits of your vision.  The room is lit 
     143by bolts of lightening which shimmer through all the colors of the
     143spectrum as the emanate from the east and ricochet toward the west
     143an immense sapphire portal set into the center of the wall marks the
     143eastern end of the ancient hall.  The hall continues out of sight to
     143the west, where the lighting grows dimmer.
     144You are in a large room with walls of solid oak.  There is a huge stone 
     144block in the center of the room, upon which rests an open book. 
     144The north and south walls are lined with bookshelves which stretch
     144the thirty feet from floor to ceiling.  There is a large mahogany chair 
     144facing the block with the open book.  The east wall is covered floor
     144to ceiling with a tapestry of finest silk, which depicts some great 
     144battle between the forces of good and evil.  There is an immense
     144sapphire portal set into the west wall. 
     145You are vacuumed into an immense whirlpool so tremendous that you 
     145cannot see the other side.  Water streams from the walls amd roof as
     145it feeds into the cascade of angry water which rips turbidly down 
     145and out of sight.  As you are drawn further and further toward the
     145madly racing center, your speed builds into a frenzied rush, and you
     145become dizzy from the speed.  Just before you black out, you feel the 
     145mad water closing over you. 
     147You are in a gloomy stairway which slopes downward to the west. 
     147There is a doorway to the east, through which quiet gurgling can be heard.
     147The rancid stench grows stronger. 
     148You are in a gloomy stairway which slopes upward to the east. 
     148The stench drifting from the southward doorway into the kitchen 
     148has grown slightly more tolerable.
     149You enter the door and are almost overpowered by a rancid stench
     149which hangs heavy in the air.  Several pots and pans of glop sit
     149decomposing on the stove, while rats run rampant through the cabinets.
     149Typical signs of Bogman cooking.
     150You are in the Bogman room.  Papers and clothes are everywhere.  In the 
     150corner a confused gerbil imitates a fountain.  In another corner stands 
     150an empty garbage can.  On the south wall is a badly abused dartboard
     150the bullseye is replaced by a picture of a teenage girl, labeled
     150"Sweetpeat".  A narrow passageway to the north leads to the kitchen.
     151Dead end.

     157There is a big rock to the northwest and a tiny patch of grass to the 
     157northeast.
     158You are in an east/west passage; the walls are throbbing in silent thunder. 
     158A dim light can be seen to the west.
     159As you go west, you must squeeze past something which brushes past your 
     159face.  Suddenly you find...

       1Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in
       1treasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never 
       1seen again.  Magic is said to work in the cave.  I will be your eyes
       1and hands.  Direct me with commands of 1 or 2 words.  I should warn

       2A little dwarf with a big knife blocks your way.
       3A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you, threw a little 
       3axe at you which missed, cursed, and ran away.
       4There is a threatening little dwarf in the room with you! 
       5One sharp nasty knife is thrown at you! 
       6None of them hit you! 
       7One of them gets you! 
       8The faintly glowing lichen seems to spell "Dwight". 
       9There is no way to go that direction. 
      10I am unsure how you are facing.  Use compass points or nearby objects.
      11I don't know in from out here.  Use compass points or name something
      11in the general direction you want to go.
      12I don't know how to apply that word here. 
      13You can't row a boat without a boat!
      14I'm game.  Would you care to explain how? 
      15Sorry, but i am not allowed to give more detail.  I will repeat the 
      15long description of your location.
      16It is now pitch dark.  If you proceed you will likely fall into a pit.
      17If you prefer, simply type W rather than west.
      18Are you trying to catch the mongoose? 
      19The mongoose is frightened right now and you cannot catch it no matter
      19what you try.  Perhaps you might try later. 
      20Are you trying to somehow deal with the snake?
      21You can't kill the snake, or drive it away, or avoid it, or anything
      21like that.  There is a way to get by, but you don't have the necessary
      21resources right now.
      22Do you really want to quit now? 
      23You fell into a pit and broke every bone in your body!
      24You are already carrying it!
      25You can't be serious! 
      26The mongoose was unafraid when you entered, but as you approach it
      26becomes disturbed and you cannot catch it.
      27You can catch the mongoose, but you cannot carry it.
      28There is nothing here with a lock!
      29You aren't carrying it! 
      30The mongoose attacks the green snake, and in an astounding flurry 
      30drives the snake away.
      31You have no keys! 
      32It has no lock. 
      33I don't know how to lock or unlock such a thing.
      34It was already locked.
      35The grate is now locked.
      36The grate is now unlocked.
      37It was already unlocked.
      38You have no source of light.
      39Your lamp is now on.
      40Your lamp is now off. 
      41There is no way to get past the bear to unlock the chain, which is
      41probably just as well.
      42Nothing happens.
      43  The runes are in elvish of an ancient mode, and read:  "Ennyn 
      43Durin Aran Moria:  Pedo mellon a minno.  Im Narvi hain echant:  
      43Celebrimboro Eregion teithanti thiw hin."  Being a scholar of 
      43classical languages, including ancient Elvish, I can translate
      43them, and they read as follows:  "The doors of Durin, Lord of 
      43Moria.  Speak, friend, and enter.  I, Narvi, made them. 
      43Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs."
      44There is nothing here to attack.
      45The mongoose is now dead.  Its body disappears. 
      46Attacking the snake both doesn't work and is very dangerous.
      47You killed a little dwarf.
      48You attack a little dwarf, but he dodges out of the way.
      49With what?  your bare hands?
      50Good try, but that is an old worn-out magic word. 
      51I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my vocabulary 
      51describes places and is used to move you there.  To move, try words 
      51like forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west, north, south, 
      51up, or down.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod
      51hidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of 
      51the action words that i know.  Usually you will need to give both the 
      51object and action words (in either order), but sometimes i can infer
      51the object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in
      51particular, "inventory" implies "take inventory", which causes me to
      51give you a list of what you're carrying.  The objects have side 
      51effects; for instance, the rod scares the mongoose.  Usually people 
      51having trouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Those people
      51trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something
      51beyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely
      51different tack.  To speed the game you can sometimes move long
      51distances with a single word.  For example, "building" usually gets 
      51you to the building from anywhere above ground except when lost in the
      51forest.  Also, note that cave passages turn a lot, and that leaving a 
      51room to the north does not guarantee entering the next from the south.
      51good luck!
      52It misses!
      53It gets you!
      54Ok
      55You can't unlock the keys.
      56You have crawled around in some little holes and wound up back in the 
      56main passage. 
      57I don't know where the cave is, but hereabouts no stream can run on 
      57the surface for long.  I would try the stream.
      58I need more detailed instructions to do that. 
      59I can only tell you what you see as you move about and manipulate 
      59things.  I cannot tell you where remote things are. 
      60A quick little mongoose has run into the room.
      61A quick little mongoose has run out of the room.
      62Are you trying to get into the cave?
      63The grate is very solid and has a hardened steel lock.  You cannot
      63enter without a key, and there are no keys nearby.  I would recommend 
      63looking elsewhere for the keys. 
      64The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple, with an 
      64occasional grove of pine or spruce.  There is quite a bit of under- 
      64growth, largely birch and ash saplings plus nondescript bushes of 
      64various sorts.  This time of year visibility is quite restricted by 
      64all the leaves, but travel is quite easy if you detour around the 
      64spruce and berry bushes.
      65Welcome to adventure!!  Would you like instructions?
      66Digging without a shovel is quite impractical.  Even with a shovel
      66progress is unlikely. 
      67Blasting requires dynamite. 
      68I'm as confused as you are. 
      69Mist is a white vapor, usually water, seen from time to time in 
      69caverns.  It can be found anywhere but is frequently a sign of a deep 
      69pit leading down to water.
      70You are now soaking wet!
      71I think i just lost my appetite.
      72Thank you, it was delicious!
      73You have taken a drink from the stream.  The water tastes strongly of 
      73minerals, but is not unpleasant.  It is extremely cold. 
      74The bottle of water is now empty. 
      75Rubbing the electric lamp is not particularly rewarding.  Anyway, 
      75Nothing exciting happens. 
      76Peculiar.  Nothing unexpected happens.
      77Your bottle is empty and the ground is wet. 
      78You can't pour that.
      79Pervert!
      80Which way?
      81Oh dear, you seem to have gotten yourself killed.  I might be able to 
      81help you out, but i've never really done this before.  Do you want me 
      81to try to reincarnate you?
      82All right.  But don't blame me if something goes wr...... 
      82       0       0    --- poof!! ---
      82You are engulfed in a cloud of orange smoke.  Coughing and gasping, 
      82you emerge from the smoke and find....
      83You clumsy oaf, you've done it again!  I don't know how long i can
      83keep this up.  Do you want me to try reincarnating you again? 
      84Okay, now where did i put my orange smoke?....
      84Everything disappears in a dense cloud of orange smoke. 
      85Now you've really done it!  I'm out of orange smoke!  You don't expect
      85me to do a decent reincarnation without any orange smoke, do you? 
      86Okay, if you're so smart, do it yourself!  I'm leaving! 
      91Sorry, but i no longer seem to remember how it was you got here.
      92You can't carry anything more.  You'll have to drop something first.
      93You can't go through a locked steel grate!
      94I believe what you want is right here with you. 
      95You don't fit through a two-inch slit!
      96I respectfully suggest you go across the bridge instead of jumping. 
      97There is no way across the fissure from here. 
      98You're not carrying anything. 
      99You are currently holding the following:  
     100It's not hungry (it's merely pinin' for the fjords).  Besides, you
     100have no mongoose seed.
     101The snake has now devoured your mongoose. 
     102There's nothing here it wants to eat (except perhaps you).
     103You fool, dwarves eat only coal!  Now you've made him *really* mad!!
     104You have nothing in which to carry it.
     105Your bottle is already full.
     106There is nothing here with which to fill the bottle.
     107Your bottle is now full of water. 
     108Your bottle is now full of oil. 
     109You can't fill that.
     110Don't be ridiculous!
     111The door is extremely rusty and refuses to open.
     112The plant indignantly shakes the oil off its leaves and asks, "Water?"
     113The hinges are quite thoroughly rusted now and won't budge. 
     114The oil has freed up the hinges so that the door will now move, 
     114although it requires some effort. 
     115The plant has exceptionally deep roots and cannot be pulled free. 
     116The dwarves' knives vanish as they strike the walls of the cave.
     117Something you're carrying won't fit through the tunnel with you.
     117You'd best take inventory and drop something. 
     118You can't fit this five-foot clam through that little passage!
     119You can't fit this five-foot oyster through that little passage!
     120I advise you to put down the clam before opening it.
     121I advise you to put down the oyster before opening it.
     122You don't have anything strong enough to open the clam. 
     123You don't have anything strong enough to open the oyster. 
     124A glistening pearl falls out of the clam and rolls away.  Goodness, 
     124this must really be an oyster.  (I never was very good at identifying 
     124bivalves.)  Whatever it is, it has now snapped shut again.
     125The oyster creaks open, revealing nothing but oyster inside.  It
     125promptly snaps shut again.
     126You have crawled around in some little holes and found your way 
     126blocked by a recent cave-in.  You are now back in the main passage. 
     127There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you. 
     128Out from the shadows behind you pounces a bearded pirate!  "Har, har,"
     128he chortles, "I'll just take all this booty and hide it away with me
     128chest deep in the maze!"  He snatches your treasure and vanishes into 
     128the gloom.
     129A sepulchral voice reverberating through the cave, says, "Cave closing
     129soon.  All adventurers exit immediately through main office." 
     130A mysterious recorded voice groans into life and announces: 
     130   "This exit is closed.  Please leave via main office."
     131It looks as though you're dead.  Well, seeing as how it's so close to 
     131closing time anyway, I think we'll just call it a day.
     132The sepulchral voice entones, "The cave is now closed."  As the echoes
     132fade, there is a blinding flash of light (and a small puff of orange
     132smoke). . . .    as your eyes refocus, you look around and find...
     133There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
     133wall, burying the dwarves in the rubble.  You march through the hole
     133and find yourself in the main office, where a cheering band of
     133friendly elves carry the conquering adventurer off into the sunset. 
     134There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
     134wall, burying the snakes in the rubble.  A river of molten lava pours 
     134in through the hole, destroying everything in its path, including you!
     135There is a loud explosion, and you are suddenly splashed across the 
     135walls of the room.
     136The resulting ruckus has awakened the dwarves.  There are now several 
     136threatening little dwarves in the room with you!  Most of them throw
     136knives at you!  All of them get you!
     137Oh, leave the poor unhappy mongoose alone.
     138I daresay whatever you want is around here somewhere. 
     139I don't know the word "STOP".  use "QUIT" if you want to give up. 
     140You can't get there from here.
     141You are being followed by a very large, tame bear.
     142If you want to end your adventure early, say "QUIT".
     142To suspend your adventure such that you can continue later, say 
     142"SUSPEND" (or "PAUSE" or "SAVE").  To re-start your game at a later 
     142time, start up a new adventure and after i say "You are standing...", 
     142you must say "RESTORE".  you can't say "RESTORE" at any other 
     142time, however. 
     142To see how well you're doing, say "SCORE".  To get full credit for a
     142treasure, you must have left it safely in the building, though you get
     142partial credit just for locating it.  You lose points for getting 
     142killed, or for quitting, though the former costs you more.  There are 
     142also points based on how much (if any) of the cave you've managed to
     142explore; in particular, there is a large bonus just for getting in (to
     142distinguish the beginners from the rest of the pack), and there are 
     142other ways to determine whether you've been through some of the more
     142harrowing sections.  If you think you've found all the treasures, just
     142keep exploring for a while.  If nothing interesting happens, you
     142haven't found them all yet.  If something interesting *does* happen,
     142it means you're getting a bonus and have an opportunity to garner many
     142more points in the master's section.  I may occasionally offer hints
     142if you seem to be having trouble.  If i do, i'll warn you in advance
     142how much it will affect your score to accept the hints.  Finally, to
     142save paper, you may specify "brief", which tells me never to repeat 
     142the full description of a place unless you explicitly ask me to.
     143Do you indeed wish to quit now? 
     144There is nothing here with which to fill the vase.
     145The sudden change in temperature has delicately shattered the vase. 
     146It is beyond your power to do that. 
     147I don't know how. 
     148It is too far up for you to reach.
     149You killed a little dwarf.  The body vanishes in a cloud of greasy
     149black smoke.
     150The shell is very strong and is impervious to attack. 
     151What's the matter, can't you read?  Now you'd best start over.
     152The axe bounces harmlessly off the dragon's thick scales. 
     153The dragon looks rather nasty.  You'd best not try to get by. 
     154The mongoose attacks the red-golden dragon, and in an astounding flurry 
     154gets burnt to a cinder.  The ashes blow away. 
     155On what?
     156Okay, from now on i'll only describe a place in full the first time 
     156you come to it.  To get the full description, say "look". 
     157Trolls are close relatives with the rocks and have skin as tough as 
     157that of a rhinoceros.  The troll fends off your blows effortlessly. 
     158the troll deftly catches the axe, examines it carefully, and tosses it
     158back, declaring, "Good workmanship, but it's not valuable enough."
     159The troll catches your treasure and scurries away out of sight. 
     160The troll refuses to let you cross. 
     161There is no longer any way across the chasm.
     162Just as you reach the other side, the bridge buckles beneath the
     162weight of the bear, which was still following you around.  You
     162Scrabble desperately for support, but as the bridge collapses you 
     162stumble back and fall into the chasm. 
     163The bear lumbers toward the troll, who lets out a startled shriek and 
     163scurries away.  The bear soon gives up the pursuit and wanders back.
     164The axe misses and lands near the bear where you can't get at it. 
     165With what?  Your bare hands?  Against *HIS* bear hands??
     166The bear is confused; he only wants to be your friend.
     167For crying out loud, the poor thing is already dead!
     168The bear eagerly wolfs down your food, after which he seems to calm 
     168down considerably and even becomes rather friendly. 
     169The bear is still chained to the wall.
     170The chain is still locked.
     171The chain is now unlocked.
     172The chain is now locked.
     173There is nothing here to which the chain can be locked. 
     174There is nothing here to eat. 
     175Do you want the hint? 
     176Do you need help getting out of the maze? 
     177You can make the passages look less alike by dropping things. 
     178Are you trying to explore beyond the plover room? 
     179There is a way to explore that region without having to worry about 
     179Falling into a pit.  none of the objects available is immediately 
     179Useful in discovering the secret. 
     180Do you need help getting out of here? 
     181Don't go west.
     182Gluttony is not one of the troll's vices.  Avarice, however, is.
     183Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best start wrapping this up, unless
     183you can find some fresh batteries.  I seem to recall there's a vending
     183machine in the maze.  Bring some coins with you.
     184Your lamp has run out of power. 
     185There's not much point in wandering around out here, and you can't
     185explore the cave without a lamp.  So let's just call it a day.
     186There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.  As you 
     186turn toward them, the beam of your lamp falls across a bearded pirate.
     186He is carrying a large chest.  "Shiver me timbers!" he cries, "I've 
     186been spotted!  I'd best hie meself off to the maze to hide me chest!" 
     186With that, he vanishes into the gloom.
     187Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best go back for those batteries.
     188Your lamp is getting dim.  i'm taking the liberty of replacing the
     188batteries.
     189Your lamp is getting dim, and you're out of spare batteries.  You'd 
     189best start wrapping this up.
     190There's not much to read.  it's filled with obscure color diagrams, 
     190and something about "36-24-36".  It must be an obscure mathematics journal. 
     191"This is not the maze where the pirate leaves his treasure chest."
     192Hmmm, this looks like a clue, which means it'll cost you 10 points to 
     192read it.  Should i go ahead and read it anyway? 
     193It says, "There is something strange about this place, such that one
     193of the words i've always known now has a new effect." 
     194It says the same thing it did before. 
     195I'm afraid i don't understand.
     196"Congratulations on bringing light into the dark-room!" 
     197You strike the mirror a resounding blow, whereupon it shatters into a 
     197myriad tiny fragments.
     198You have taken the vase and hurled it delicately to the ground. 
     199You prod the nearest dwarf, who wakes up grumpily, takes one look at
     199you, curses, and grabs for his axe. 
     200Is this acceptable? 
     201There's no point in suspending a demonstration game.
     202Where?
     203The silver lines fade and the door becomes almost invisible.  The 
     203door does not open. 
     204I like you too, but flattery will get you nowhere.
     205As you wave the rod towards the fissure, the rod slips from your clumsy 
     205fingers and tumbles into the fissure; it hits a ledge far below and 
     205disappears from sight.
 You klutz! 
     206You have taken a drink of water from the foutain. Its flavor is strange,
     206but not unpleasant. You feel perfectly normal.
     207You have taken a drink from the fountain. The liquid is sweet and quite 
     207pleasant. you feel great; I'd bet that you can lift twice as much 
     207stuff as before.
     208You have taken a drink from the fountain. the Liquid is sour. 
     208You have dropped everything onto the floor and passed out.
     208. .. ... ....as you regain consciousness, you feel very, very weak. 
     209You cannot drink anything more; your bladder is full! 
     210   
ahhhh....

     211A bolt of lightning spurts from the switch and broils your arm! 
     211You have gotten elctrocuted!
     212The lights flicker once... and suddenly the entire cave is filled with a
     212brilliant blue-white glow.
     213The cave is now dark. 
     214Oh...   ///Heartburn\\\ 
     214            --and-- 
     214        \\\Hemoroids///   
...Where is the *PLOP-PLOP* *FIZZ-FIZZ*???
     215You just drank the bitter potion of instant death!
     216The hungry dwarf just ran off with your coal. 
     217There is no dwarf here right now  perhaps i should call a few.
     218Your feet are now wet.
     219You have jumped into the mirky water; as you are swiming, you see something.
     219you grab it and return to the ledge >gasping< for air.
     219You drop it to the ground.
     220You are about to have a childish accident.
     221Oops...  you just wet your pants! 
     222You cannot piss... your bladder is empty! 
     223Huh?? 
     224*TRUE* Wizards cannot die.
     225The rope just broke...
     226You can't swim without water! 
     227You jump into the water and begin swimming furiously... 
     228You jump into the water and sink straight to the bottom.
     228Would you believe you just drowned?!? 
     229The trap has captured the mongoose.

     230EYE JEST LUV SNARFING THE UPDATE, ITS ULTRA.
     231The book is open, and a passage is marked.  It says,
     231"ONE RING TO RULE THEM ALL, ONE RING TO FIND THEM,
     231 ONE RING TO BRING THEM ALL AND IN THE DARKNESS BIND THEM." 
     232You are now sitting on the cold ground. 
     233A deep rumbling voice echos through the cave. "You dare sit in The
     233Wizard's chair?!"  An enormous bolt of blue-white plasma fills the
     233room and crashes down on your insolent head. You have been burnt to 
     233a cinder. The ashes blow away.
     234The Wizard suddenly appears and says, "No, No! Musn't touch!" He
     234puts everything back just as before.
