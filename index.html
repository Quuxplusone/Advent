<div class="about"><span><p>Crowther and Woods' <i>Adventure</i> is the granddaddy
of all interactive fiction. Originally written by Will Crowther in his spare time
at BBN, it made its way onto the fledgling ARPAnet, where it was discovered by
Don Woods at the Stanford AI Lab. With Crowther's permission, Woods expanded the
game to encompass more than double the number of rooms and puzzles. <i>Adventure</i>
has been translated, ported, and imitated hundreds of times in the 36 years since
its creation.</p>

<p>This particular version of <i>Adventure</i> was written by Arthur O'Dwyer in C,
closely following a version written by Don Knuth in CWEB, which in turn was based
on Crowther and Woods' original Fortran source code.</p></span></div>

<p>This version of Adventure was created using <a href="http://github.com/Quuxplusone/Advent/">vbccz</a>,
a C compiler for the Z-machine. To play a work like this one, you need an
interpreter program: many are available, among them
<a href="http://www.logicalshift.demon.co.uk/mac/zoom.html">Zoom for Mac OS X</a> and for
<a href="http://www.logicalshift.demon.co.uk/unix/zoom/">Unix</a>;
<a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/davidk.kinder/frotz.html">Windows Frotz</a> or
<a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/davidk.kinder/glulxe.html">Windows Glulxe</a> for Windows. 
Or you can use the Parchment interpreter, without downloading anything, by following the
