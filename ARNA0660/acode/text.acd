         What? You mean you wanted to know WHEN did it all happen?! In
         illo tempore, my friend, in "time before time"...
TEXT     ORIENTAL.DRAWING
         It's just ordinary ancient oriental cave drawings of no conceivable
         interest to a mere adventurer like you.
TEXT     INTRO
         Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in
         treasure and gold, though it is rumoured that some who enter are never
         seen again. Magic is said to work in the cave.

         I will be your eyes and hands. My understanding of human language is
         limited to very simple sentences, consisting essentially of just a
         verb, followed, if appropriate, by a noun (type INFO for more
         information). Most words I know can be abbreviated to the least
         unambiguous length - in practice usually three or four characters.
         Only magic words cannot be abbreviated at all, for obvious reasons.
         To see a list of words I know, type VOCABULARY (or just VOC).

         Should you get stuck, typing HELP may result in some obscure hints.
         Other generally useful commands are LOOK, EXAMINE (e.g. EXAMINE LAMP),
         SAVE, RESTORE and QUIT. For news, if any, type NEWS.

         If you have already played an earlier version of Adventure, you may
         want to know where the differences are to be found, so that you don't
         waste your time looking for them.

         A little dwarf with a big knife blocks your way.
TEXT     FIRST.DWARF

         A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you, threw a little axe
         at you which missed, cursed, and ran away.

         There is a little axe here.
TEXT     KNIVES.THROWN

         [/One/#] nasty sharp kni[/fe is/ves are] thrown at you!

         Your magic ring shoots out a bolt of lightning that splinters
         the [/knife/knives] into dust before [/it/they] can reach you!
TEXT
         A glowing disk of black fire jumps out of your magic ring and swallows
         the hurtling [/knife/knives] before [/it/they] can harm you!
TEXT
         [/A ball/Balls] of searing flame burst[/s/] out of your magic ring,
         rebound[/s/] off of the ground, and vaporize[/s/] the 
         kni[/fe/ves] before [/it/they] can reach you.
TEXT     LAST.DEFLECTOR
         Your magic ring emits a blast of some strange magical energy that
         knocks the kni[/fe/ves] aside!
TEXT     HOLLOW.VOICE
         A hollow voice says "Plugh".
TEXT     NO.CAN.GO

TEXT
         There is no way for you to go #.
TEXT
         You cannot go #.
TEXT
         There's no exit # from here.
TEXT
         No exit # from here, I am afraid.
TEXT     OG.NAC.ON
         Going # is not possible from here. Sorry.
TEXT     OOF!
         You have run into a wall of rock and can go no further in this
         direction.
TEXT     NEED.A.DIRECTION
         I am unsure which way you are facing, please specify a direction.
TEXT     IN.FROM.OUT
         I don't know in from out here. Use compass points or name something in
         the general direction you want to go.
TEXT     VIAL.SEALED
         How? It is tightly sealed.
TEXT     NATURALLY.NOTHING
         Naturally enough, nothing happens.
TEXT     I.AM.GAME
         I'm game. Would you care to explain how?
TEXT     ONE.AT.A.TIME
         Hey, not so fast! I can only deal with one at a time - there is
         only one of me, you know...
TEXT     IT.IS.NOW.DARK
         It is now pitch dark. If you proceed you will likely fall into a pit.
FRAGMENT BIRD.HINT?
         Are you trying to catch the bird?
TEXT
         For some reason the bird is frightened right now and won't let you
         anywhere near it. This may not sound very unusual, but believe
         me - it is usually quite friendly and tame. I am no bird
         psychologist, but I'd say there must be some specific reason
         for its behaviour.
FRAGMENT GET.PAST.SNAKE?
         Are you trying somehow to deal with the snake?
TEXT
         You can't kill the snake, or drive it away, or avoid or bribe it,
         or anything like that. It is, however, entirely possible to get rid
         of it.
FRAGMENT NOGET.PAST.SNAKE?
         Are you trying somehow to deal with the snake?
TEXT
         You can't kill the snake, or drive it away, or avoid or bribe it,
         or anything like that. It is, of course, entirely possible to get rid
         of it, but you have very carelessly blown your only chance to do so.
TEXT     CRUNCH
         You fell into a pit and broke every bone in your body!
TEXT     YOU.HAVE.IT
         You are already carrying the #!
TEXT     BE.SERIOUS!
         You can't be serious!
TEXT     BIRD.IS.SCARED
         The bird was unafraid when you entered, but as you approach it becomes
         disturbed and you cannot catch it.
TEXT     NEED.CAGE
         You might be able to catch the bird, but you have no means of
         carrying it.
TEXT     YOU.ARENT.CARRYING
         You aren't carrying the #!
TEXT     I.DONT.SEE
         I see no # here.
TEXT     BIRD.V.SNAKE
         The little bird attacks the green snake, and in an astounding flurry
         drives the snake away.
TEXT     NEED.KEYS
         You have no keys!
TEXT     NO.LOCK
         It has no lock.
TEXT     GRATE.NOW
         [The grate/The grate/I am taking the liberty of assuming that 
         you meant to unlock the grate first. It] [clicks itself/is
         now] [locked/unlocked/unlocked and open].[/  Anticipating your
         next wish, I've opened it for you as well./]
TEXT     GRATE.STUCK
         The lock seems to be stuck - the key refuses to turn!
TEXT     NO.LIGHT.HERE
         You have no source of light.
TEXT     LAMP.NOW
         The lamp is now o[ff/n].
TEXT     LAMP.ALREADY
         The lamp was [not/already] lit!
TEXT     CANT.GET.PAST.BEAR
         There is no way to get past the bear to unlock the chain, which is
         probably just as well.
TEXT     NOTHING
         Nothing happens.
TEXT     WHERE?
         What, #? Where?
TEXT     PACIFIST
         There's nothing here to attack.
TEXT     BIRD.IS.DEAD
         The little bird is now dead. Its body disappears.
TEXT     CANT.KILL.SNAKE
         Attacking the snake both doesn't work and is very dangerous.
TEXT     KILLED.DWARF
         You killed a little dwarf.
TEXT     DWARF.DODGES
         You attack a little dwarf, but he dodges out of the way.
TEXT     DWARF.STABS
         You attack a little dwarf, but he dodges out of the way and stabs you
         with his nasty sharp knife! I can't say I am really surprised; them
         dwarves have quite a reputation for hand to hand fighting.
FRAGMENT WITH.WHAT?
         With your bare hands??
TEXT     OLDFASHIONED.MAGIC
         Good try, but that's a worn out, oldfashioned magic word.
TEXT     HELP.DATA
         Imagine that you are somewhere else (far, far away, in a strange land
         of magic and wonder). As your guide, I will describe to you your
         surroundings while you tell me what you want to do next. For example,
         to move, try words like ENTER (and EXIT), EAST (or E for short), NORTH
         (or N), SOUTHWEST (or SW), UP (or U) etc. (You don't have to say
         GO EAST etc., just the direction will do). Words like DOWNSTREAM,
         CLIMB, CROSS may also come handy. Some other useful commands
         are INVENTORY (or I), LOOK (or L, or EXAMINE, or X), SCORE, INFO,
         VOCABULARY etc.

         In addition to the special abbreviations (like I for Inventory), all
         words, other than magic ones, can be abbreviated to the shortest
         unambiguous length. READ, for instance, can be shortened to REA but
         not RE, since it would clash with REMOVE. Generally you will find that
         most words abbreviate to three or four characters.

         Objects can be manipulated using some of the verbs that I know.
         Usually you have to give both the object and the verb (in either
         order), but sometimes I can infer the object from the verb alone - e.g.
         both LIGHT (or ON) and EXTINGUISH (or OFF) imply LAMP. Some objects
         have side-effects; for instance, rods scare birds.
TEXT     HELP.DATA.END
         Remember that I only understand commands of one or two words. Novice
         players often forget that, for example, THROW AXE AT DWARF is not
         going to do anything different from what THROW AXE would achieve.
         Usually people trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are
         attempting something beyond their (or my) capabilities and should try
         a completely different tack.

         To speed up the game you can sometimes move long distances with a
         single word. For example BUILDING usually gets you to the building
         from most places above ground except when lost in the forest. Also,
         note that cave passages turn a lot, and that leaving a room to the
         north does not guarantee entering the next from the south.

         Finally, it is worth remembering that I mostly mean just what I say.
         On the other hand, do not assume that everything to be seen or found
         in the Colossal Cave has any particular purpose, even though most
         things and beings do have one (or more).

        +                                             Good luck!
TEXT     CANT.HELP.YOU
         Well, you do seem to be having problems, don't you? Unfortunately, I'm
         not allowed to help you out; you got yourself into this, and you'll
         have to find a solution to your problems yourself.
TEXT     NO.MORE.HELP
         I'm afraid that I can't tell you anything more that would be useful;
         you'll have to figure out what to do on your own.
TEXT     NO.UNLOCK.KEYS
         You can't unlock the keys.
TEXT     STILL.WHERE.YOU.WERE
         You have crawled around in some little holes and wound up back in the
         main passage.
TEXT     TRY.FOLLOWING.STREAM
         I don't know where the cave is, but hereabouts no stream can run on the
         surface for long. I would try the stream.
TEXT     NEED.MORE.DETAIL
         I need more detailed instructions to do that.
TEXT     FIND.IT.YOURSELF
         I can only tell you what you see as you move about and manipulate
         things. I cannot tell you where remote things or places are.
TEXT     NOCOMPRENDE
         I trust you know how to "#", because I don't.
TEXT
         Embarassing though the admission is, I've never learned to "#".
TEXT
         Sorry to disappoint you, but I haven't got a clue how to "#".
TEXT
         I am afraid "#" is not a verb I understand.
TEXT
         I don't know how to "#". I guess it isn't really essential.
TEXT     NOCOMPRENDE.OBJECT
         Ahem... "#" is not in my dictionary. Would you care to re-phrase?
TEXT
         I trust you know what "#" might be, 'cause I don't.
TEXT
         What's this "#" dhoobrey? I wasn't briefed on it!...
TEXT
         'Fraid "#" is not something I've ever met. Is it edible?
TEXT
         And "#" to you too, whatever it means!
TEXT     EDNERPMOCON
         What, "#"? Never heard of it!
TEXT     WHAT?
         Huh??
FRAGMENT CANT.GET.IN?
         Are you trying to get into the cave?
TEXT
         The grate is very solid and has a hardened steel lock. You cannot
         enter without a key, and there are no keys nearby. I would recommend
         looking elsewhere for the keys.
TEXT     IN.FOREST

         The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple, with an
         occasional grove of pine or spruce. There is quite a bit of
         undergrowth, largely birch and ash saplings as well as nondescript
         bushes of various sorts. This time of year visibility is quite
         restricted by all the leaves, but travel is quite easy if you
         detour around the spruce and berry bushes.
TEXT     HI.THERE
         Welcome to Adventure4+ \[660 point MLA version 10.10 - 29 Jan 2009\]
TEXT     NEED.SHOVEL
         Digging without a shovel is quite impractical. Even with a shovel
         progress is unlikely.
TEXT     NEED.DYNAMITE
         Blasting requires dynamite.
TEXT     I.AM.CONFUSED
         I'm as confused as you are.
TEXT     THIS.IS.MIST
         Mist is a white vapor, usually water, seen from time to time in
         caverns. It can be found anywhere but is frequently a sign of a deep
         pit leading down to water.
TEXT     BLEAH
         Yeetttch! I think I just lost my appetite.
TEXT     URRP
         Thank you, it was delicious!
TEXT     SLURP
         You have taken a drink from the stream. The water tastes strongly of
         minerals, but is not unpleasant. It is extremely cold.
TEXT     SALT.H20.BAD
         I'm afraid that all that's available here is salt water, which isn't
         good for anything much... you'd better try elsewhere.
TEXT     BOTTLE.NOW.EMPTY
         The bottle of water is now empty.
TEXT     YOU.RUB.LAMP
         Rubbing the electric # is not particularly rewarding. Anyway, nothing
         exciting happens.
TEXT     PECULIAR
         Peculiar. Nothing unexpected happens.
TEXT     REPULSIVE
         What a repulsive idea!
TEXT     POUR.LIQUID
         The # pours out, making a wet patch on the ground.
TEXT     GROUND.IS.DAMP
         The ground here is damp.
TEXT     CANT.POUR
         You can't pour that.
TEXT     FUCK.FIRST
         Some manners...
TEXT
         If you must. Just pardon me if I look away.
TEXT
         Watch it!
TEXT
         Please, not in public!
TEXT
         Bad language will get you nowhere.
TEXT
         Look, if you want to be vulgar, at least try to be imaginative
         about it.
TEXT
         Why is it that every bright spark has to demonstrate his superiority
         over the computer by typing in swear words? I just don't get it...
TEXT     FUCK.LAST
         Do you think you could restrain yourself until the end of the game?
TEXT     WHICH.WAY?
         Which way should I #?
FRAGMENT YOU.ARE.DEAD
         Oh dear, you seem to have gotten yourself killed. I might be able to
         help you out, but I've never really done this before. 

         Do you want me to try to reincarnate you?
TEXT
         All right. But don't blame me if something goes wr......
        =                     -- poof!! --
         You are engulfed in a cloud of orange smoke. Coughing and gasping, you
         emerge from the smoke and find....
FRAGMENT
         Tsk, tsk - you did it again! Remember - you're only human, and you
         don't have as many lives as a cat! (at least, I don't think so...)
         That's twice you've ended up dead. 

         Want to try for three?
TEXT
         As you wish. Hang on for just a second while I fire up my thurible...

         you find that once again....
FRAGMENT
         You clumsy oaf, you've done it again! I don't know how long I can keep
         this up.

TEXT
         Okay, now where did I put my orange smoke?.... \>poof!\< Everything
         disappears in a dense cloud of orange smoke.
FRAGMENT
         Now you've really done it! I'm out of orange smoke! You don't expect
         me to do a decent reincarnation without any orange smoke, do you?

         Come on, own up... DO YOU???
TEXT
         Yes... well, that's the kind of blinkered, Philistine pig-ignorance
         that I've come to expect from you mortals. You sit there on your
         loathsome, spotty behind, squeezing blackheads and not caring a
         thinker's damn about the struggling cave-sprite, you simpering,
         whining, moldy-faced heap of parrot droppings! If you're so smart,
         then you can just reincarnate yourself, because quite frankly I'm as
         mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore - I'm leaving!!!!

         Your possessions currently consist of:
TEXT     BIRD.NOT.HUNGRY
         It's not hungry (it's merely pinin' for the fjords). Besides, you have
         no bird seed.
TEXT     SNAKE.EATS.BIRD
         The snake has now devoured your bird.
TEXT     IT.WONT.EAT
         There's nothing here it wants to eat (except perhaps you).

TEXT     DOOR.NEEDS.OIL
         The door is extremely rusty and refuses to open.
TEXT     YOU.OIL.THE.PLANT
         The plant indignantly shakes the oil off its leaves and asks, "Water?"
TEXT     HINGES..RUST
         The hinges are quite thoroughly rusted now and won't budge.
TEXT     DOOR.NOW.OILED
         The oil has freed up the hinges so that the door will now move,
         although it requires some effort.
TEXT     ROOTS.TOO.DEEP
         The plant has exceptionally deep roots and cannot be pulled free.
TEXT     KNIVES.GO.POOF
         The dwarves' knives vanish as they strike the walls of the cave.
TEXT     SOMETHING.DOESNT.FIT
         Something you're carrying won't fit through the tunnel with you. You'd
         best take inventory and drop something.

         You can't fit this five-foot # through that little passage!
TEXT     TOO.MANY.STREAMS

TEXT     NO.OPEN.BIVALVE
         You don't have anything strong enough to open the #.
TEXT     CLAM.OPENED
         A glistening pearl falls out of the clam and rolls away. Goodness,
         this must really be an oyster. (I never was very good at identifying
         bivalves.) Whatever it is, it has now snapped shut again.
TEXT     OYSTER.OPENED
         The oyster creaks open, revealing nothing but oyster inside. It
         promptly snaps shut again.
TEXT     CRAWL.CAVED.IN
         You have crawled around in some little holes and found your way
         blocked by a recent cave-in. You are now back in the main passage.
TEXT     RUSTLING
         There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.
TEXT     PIRATE.ROBS

         Out from the shadows behind you pounces a bearded pirate! "Har, har,"
         he chortles, "I'll just take all this booty and hide it away with me

TEXT     ROBBED.AGAIN!

         Out from the darkness behind you leaps the pirate! "Har, har," he
         chortles nastily, "I see you've found some more treasure for me!
         Thanks, me hearty, you're doing just fine!" With that, he snatches
         your treasure and slips away into the gloom, chuckling with glee.
TEXT     CLOSING.NOW

         A sepulchral voice reverberating through the cave, says, "Cave closing
         soon. All adventurers please report to the treasure room via the
         alternate entrance to claim your treasure."
TEXT     EXIT.CLOSED

         A mysterious recorded voice groans into life and announces:

        =   "This exit is closed. Please report to the treasure room
        =      via the alternate entrance to claim your treasure."
TEXT     DEAD.&.CLOSED

         It looks as though you're dead. Well, seeing as how it's so close to
         closing time anyway, I think we'll just call it a day.
TEXT     CAVE.NOW.CLOSED

         The sepulchral voice intones, "The cave is now closed." As the echoes
         fade, there is a blinding flash of light (and a small puff of orange
         smoke).... As your eyes refocus, you look around and find...

TEXT     DONT.KNOW.THE.WAY
         I don't know how to get there from here.
TEXT     YOU.ARE.THERE
         That's where you are now!
TEXT     BEAR.FOLLOWS
         You are being followed by a very large, tame bear.
TEXT     INFO.FIRST
         This is the GLAXO UK 660 point version of the one and only
         Adventure. (ADVENTURE4 - type HISTORY for a brief summary of its
         development). The game now has well over 300 locations and an
         untold treasure of snide remarks (over 200Kb of text altogether).

         ADVENTURE4 accepts only simple verb/noun commands. It is,
         however, possible to specify more than one object with a single
         verb. For instance GET KEYS AND LAMP will pick up both, even
         though it still counts as two turns. Commas can be used in place
         of ANDs to save typing. If you are really lazy, GET ALL and DROP
         ALL also work, again taking the appropriate number of turns.

         Certain words (A, AN, THAT, THE, THIS and TO) are ignored by the
         parser, making GET THE AXE a legal command. Some verbs (e.g.
         GET) do not need a noun, provided only one object is present to
         which the verb can be applied.

         Commands can be chained together with full stops or with
         semicolons (e.g. THROW AXE.GET AXE). The special verb AGAIN can
         be used to repeat the previous command line, or, when embedded in
         a longer command sequence, the previous command in the sequence.
TEXT
         All words can be abbreviated to the shortest unambiguous length.
         In addition, the usual special abbreviations exist (E for EAST,
         SE for SOUTHEAST, U for UP...). Some additional abbreviations
         are G or T for GET (or TAKE), DR or R for DROP (or RELEASE), X
         for EXAMINE (or LOOK), TH for THROW and I for INVENTORY.

         If you want to end your adventure early, say Q (or QUIT). To
         suspend your adventure such that you can continue later, say SAVE
         \<name\> (or PAUSE or SUSPEND), where \<name\> is the name you wish
         this particular save-image to be known by (it must be a single
         word of between 1 and 12 characters). To re-start your game at a
         later time, start up a new one and say RESTORE \<name\>. If you
         forget to specify the name, the program will prompt you for it.

         To see how well you're doing, say SCORE. To get full credit for
         a treasure, you must have left it safely in the building, though
         you get partial credit just for locating it. There are also
         points based on your achievements; in particular, there is a
         large bonus just for getting in (to distinguish the beginners
         from the rest of the pack), and there are other ways to determine
         whether you've been through some of the more harrowing sections.
TEXT
         You lose points for getting killed, or for quitting, though the
         former costs you more.

         If you think you've got all the treasures in the building, just
         keep exploring the cave for a while. If nothing interesting
         happens, you haven't collected them all yet. If something
         interesting *does* happen, it means you're getting a bonus and
         have an opportunity to garner many more points in the master's
         section.

         Do remember to examine things. It is not essential to do so, but
         sometimes my responses may suggest particular properties or
         limitations of objects you find in the cave. If you seem to be
         having trouble, I may occasionally offer hints. If I do, I'll
         warn you in advance how much it will affect your score.

         Also remember that some descriptions contain details which are
         mere windowdressing. You can usually tell if this is the case by
         trying words I use in describing present features. If I don't
         know the words or am obviously misunderstanding them, it is safe
         to assume that such features cannot be in fact manipulated
         and that you would be wasting your time trying to do so.
TEXT     INFO.LAST
         Finally, I will not normally repeat the full description of a
         place after the first time unless you explicitly ask me to by
         saying LOOK. You can instruct me always to give the full
         description by typing VERBOSE. On the other hand, if you are an
         experienced adventurer, you may wish to suppress long
         descriptions altogether by specifying TERSE. In the TERSE mode I
         will never under any circumstances give the full description of a
         place. You can always revert to the normal mode of operation by
         saying NORMAL.

TEXT     WIZARD.ENDS

         A large cloud of green smoke appears in front of you. It clears away
         to reveal a tall wizard, clothed in grey. He fixes you with a steely
         glare and declares, "This adventure has lasted too long." With that he
         makes a single pass over you with his hands, and everything around you
         fades away into a grey nothingness.

TEXT     SLIMED
         As you enter into the passage, you are forced to brush up against some

         rapidly digests away all of your flesh.
TEXT     FZAP
         With a sharp sizzling sound, a large spark of electricity jumps out of

TEXT     LAMP.GOES.POOF
         With a loud "zap" a bolt of lightning springs out of midair and strikes

TEXT     LAMP.EXPLODES
         In a loud crackle of electricity, a bolt of lightning jumps out of

         grenade, and you are mown down by a cloud of shrapnel.
TEXT     LAMP.RECHARGED
         The air fills with tension, and there is a subdued crackling sound. A
         blue aura forms about your lantern, and small sparks jump from the
         lantern to the ground. The aura fades away after several seconds, and
         your lamp is once again shining brightly.

         As you reach the middle of the bridge, the troll appears from out of

         Magician," he shouts, "you like to use magic to steal back my
         hard-earned toll? Let's see how you like a little of MY magic!!" With
         that, he aims a tube running from the backpack directly at the bear and
         pulls a trigger. A spout of magical fire roars out and singes the
         bear's fur; the bear bellows in pain and dashes onto the bridge to
         escape. The bridge shudders, groans, and collapses under the weight,
         and you and the bear plunge down into the chasm.

         the bridge supports, causing the bridge to sway giddily and collapse
         into the chasm. You plunge down to your death.
TEXT     SWORD.MISSES
         The sword misses the bear, bounces off of the wall, and lands at your

TEXT     SLIDE.SLIPPERY

TEXT     OGRE.BLOCKS.WAY
         The ogre growls at you and refuses to let you pass.
TEXT     OGRE.CHOPS.YOU
         The ogre contemptuously catches the # in mid-swing, rips it out of
         your hands, and uses it to chop off your head. This might have worked
         with dwarves, but as should be obvious even to a hedgehog, ogrish
         arms are somewhat longer and stronger.
TEXT     OGRE.HALVES.YOU
         The ogre casually catches the # in mid-air, braces his feet, winds up
         and throws the # straight back at you with incredible force. You are
         unable to dodge it and it chops you in half.
TEXT     OGRE.KILLED
         The sword halts in mid-air, twirls like a dervish, and chants several
         bars of "Dies Irae" in a rough tenor voice. It then begins to spin like
         a rip-saw blade and flies directly at the ogre, who attempts to catch
         it without success; it strikes him full on the chest. There is a
         brilliant flash of light, a deafening roar and a cloud of oily grey
         smoke; when the smoke clears (and your eyes begin working properly
         again) you see that the ogre has vanished. The sword is lying on the
         ground moaning softly to itself.
TEXT     OGRE.TOO.TOUGH
         You attack the ogre, but he fends off your attack easily and comes very
         close to crushing your skull with *his* bare (but extremely strong)
         hands. You are forced to retreat in disgrace.
TEXT     OGRE.RIPS.HEAD.OFF
         You attack the ogre - a brave but foolish action. He quickly grabs you
         and with a heave of his mighty arms rips your body limb from limb.
TEXT     NO.ARCH
         I'm afraid I can't go that way - walking on red-hot lava is contrary to
         union regulations (and is bad for your health anyhow).
TEXT     FUMES.BURN
         As you approach the center of the archway, hot vapors saturated with
         brimstone drift up from the lava in the gorge beneath your feet. You
         are swiftly overcome by the foul gasses and, with your lungs burned
         out, fall off of the bridge and into the gorge.
TEXT     FUMES.MISS
         As you approach the center of the archway, hot vapors saturated with
         brimstone drift up from the lava in the gorge beneath your feet. The
         mithril ring on your finger quivers and glows, and the fumes eddy away
         from the bridge without harming you.

TEXT     BURN.BOTH
         As you approach the center of the archway, hot vapors saturated with
         brimstone drift up from the lava in the gorge beneath your feet. You
         and the bear are both overcome by the noxious gasses and, with your
         lungs burned out, slip off of the bridge and plummet into the gorge.
TEXT     BURN.BEAR
         As you approach the center of the archway, hot vapors saturated with
         brimstone drift up from the lava in the gorge beneath your feet. The
         mithril ring on your finger quivers and glows, and a swirling vortex
         of white vapor encircles you and protects you from the fumes. The bear
         is not so lucky, though, since the vortex is rather small; the noxious
         gasses choke it and it staggers off of the side of the arch and
         plummets into the gorge below.

TEXT     GHOST.BANG
         As you reach the center of the bridge, a ghostly figure appears in
         front of you. He (?) stands at least eight feet tall, and has the
         lower body of an enormous snake, six arms, and an angry expression on
         his face. "You'll not have my sceptre that easily!" he cries, and
         makes a complex magical gesture with his lower right arm. There is a
         brilliant flash of light and a vicious \>crack\<, and the bridge cracks
         and plummets into the gorge.

TEXT     WHISPER
         You pluck the sceptre from the skeleton's bony hand. As you do, the
         skeleton raises its head and whispers "Remember - #!" in a foreboding
         tone; it then sags to the ground and crumbles into dust which drifts
         away into the still air of the cave.
TEXT     BLEW.SAFE
         As you pluck the sceptre from the skeleton's grasp, it raises its head
         and whispers, "You blew it...". It then shivers and collapses into a
         pile of fine dust which quickly vanishes.

         Smoke trickles out from around the edges of the safe's door, and the
         door itself glows red with heat for a moment.

         A hollow voice says, "This is a Class 1 security alarm. All cave
         security forces go to Orange Alert. I repeat - Orange Alert."

         Ok - what you need to do is apply a little philosophy. To wit: there
         is a question that you need to ask whenever you explore a new room in
         this cave. In most places, the answer to the question is "yes". In
         some other places, it's "no" for an obvious reason. Right here, the
         answer is "no" but the reason isn't so obvious. If you can figure out
         what the question is, you can get out of here easily.
TEXT     BASILISK.GRUMBLES
         The basilisk stirs restlessly and grumbles in its sleep as you pass,
         but it does not awaken.
TEXT     BASILISK.STONED
         The basilisk stirs grumpily and awakens, peering sleepily about. It
         sees its reflection in the metal plate that you are carrying, shudders,
         and turns into solid granite.
TEXT     PETRIFY.ME
         The basilisk stirs grumpily and awakens, peering sleepily about. It
         spies you, growls, and stares you straight in the eye. Your body is
         instantly petrified.
TEXT     HIT.BASILISK
         You attack the basilisk mightily. It instantly awakens and looks you
         dead in the eye, and your body turns to solid rock.
TEXT     AXE.BASILISK
         The # rebounds harmlessly from the basilisk's tough scales. The
         basilisk awakens, grunting in shock, and glares at you. You are

TEXT     KILL.A.FEW
         You kill several of the gooseberry goblins with your #, but the others

         That's not a wise thing to try - djinni are essentially immortal and
         thus are pretty hard to hurt. Besides, this one seems rather friendly
         - why don't you just try releasing him?
TEXT     GOBLINS.EAT.YOU
         Goblins live exclusively on human flesh, and you can't spare any of
         your own to placate them. On the other hand, I suspect that they're
         going to eat you pretty soon whether you like it or not - you'd better
         find some way of killing them or driving them away!
TEXT     DRAGON.WARRIORS

         As each tooth strikes the ground, a fully-armed human skeleton springs
         up from where it struck and leaps to your defense! The skeletal warriors

         panic; they then salute you with their ancient and rusty swords, and
         fade silently into nothingness.
TEXT     POLITE.DJINN
         The wax seal breaks away easily. A cloud of dark smoke pours up from
         the mouth of the flask and condenses into the form of a twelve-foot
         Djinn standing in the pentagram. He pushes experimentally at the
         magical wall of the pentagram (which holds), and nods politely to you.
         "MY THANKS, OH MORTAL," he says in an incredibly deep bass voice. "IT
         HAS BEEN THREE THOUSAND YEARS SINCE SOLOMON SEALED ME INTO THAT BOTTLE,
         AND I AM GRATEFUL THAT YOU HAVE RELEASED ME. IF YOU WILL OPEN THIS
         PENTAGRAM AND LET ME GO FREE, I WILL GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE THAT YOU MAY
         ONE DAY WISH TO POSSESS."
TEXT     RUDE.DJINN
         The flask's wax seal crumbles at your touch. A large cloud of black
         smoke pours out, solidifying into the form of a twelve-foot Djinn. "AT
         LAST!" he says in an earth-shaking voice, "I KNEW THAT SOMEDAY SOMEONE
         WOULD RELEASE ME! I WOULD REWARD YOU FOR THIS, MORTAL, BUT IT HAS BEEN
         THREE THOUSAND YEARS SINCE I HAD A SOLID MEAL, AND I'M NOT GOING TO
         STAND HERE CHATTERING WHEN I COULD BE OUT EATING A SIX-INCH SIRLOIN
         STEAK. FAREWELL." With that, he somewhat rudely explodes back into
         smoke and drifts quickly out of sight.
TEXT     DJINN.ADVICE
         The pentagram's magical barrier sparks fitfully and goes down. The
         Djinn stretches gratefully and smiles at you. "AGAIN, MY THANKS," he
         says. "MY ADVICE TO YOU WILL TAKE THE FORM OF A HISTORY LESSON. WHEN
         RALPH WITT, THE ARCHITECT AND CONSTRUCTOR OF THIS CAVE, WAS VERY YOUNG,
         HE BECAME VERY INCENSED THAT HIS NAME WAS AT THE END OF THE ALPHABET.
         HE FELT (FOR SOME REASON) THAT THE LETTER W BELONGED NEAR THE BEGINNING
         OF THE ALPHABET, AND THAT ALL OF THOSE "UPSTART LETTERS WHICH UNFAIRLY
         USURPED THE BEST PLACES" SHOULD BE FORCED INTO EXILE AT THE END OF THE
         ALPHABET. HIS INSTINCT FOR MATTERS MAGICAL AND MYSTICAL LED HIM TO
         APPLY THIS STRANGE BELIEF INTO THE CAVE'S STRUCTURE WHEN HE EXCAVATED
         IT. YOU HAVEN'T YET BEEN AFFECTED BY HIS STRANGE HABITS, BUT YOU
         SHOULD REMEMBER THIS. FAREWELL, AND GOOD LUCK." With that, the Djinn
         evaporates into a cloud of smoke and drifts rapidly away.

         You step gently on Darwin the Tortoise's back, and he carries you

         A hollow voice says, "The Gallop-a-Ghost Tortoise Express is now at

         With a swoosh and a swirl of water, a large tortoise rises to the
         surface of the reservoir and paddles over to the shore near you. The
         message, "I'm Darwin - ride me!" is inscribed on his back in ornate
         letters.

         at you, and the djinn's deep voice says "GREETINGS AGAIN, MORTAL. I
         HAVE REMEMBERED A PIECE OF ANCIENT LORE THAT I LEARNED FROM MY AUNT, AN

         it were liquid! You are thrown off of your feet and tossed violently
         up and down! The cave walls begin to crumble and split from the stress!
         There is a terrible ROAR of rending rock!! The cave ceiling splits, and
         rocks plunge down and smash your lower body to a gooey paste.

         There is a violent blast in the distance! Steam and smoke drift into
         view through the rents in the walls, and furiously-bubbling red-hot
         lava flows in and surrounds you. The cave ceiling disintegrates in an
         incredible orgy of grinding destruction, and the cave walls fall and
         are pounded into fine dust.

         You are lying, badly mangled, on a small rock island in a sea of molten
         lava. Above you, the sky is faintly visible through a thick pall of
         smoke and steam. A short distance to the north, the remains of a
         well-house are sinking slowly into the bubbling ooze.

TEXT
         From somewhere nearby, there suddenly comes a sound of something
         mechanical in motion. As you turn towards it, an incredible figure
         rolls into the light of your lamp. It stands about five feet high on a
         wheeled metal pedestal, and has a globular light-filled head,
         accordion-pleated metal arms, and a cylindrical body the size of an oil
         drum with a plastic panel on the front. It rolls past without taking
         any notice of you, all the while waving its arms, flashing a light
         behind its front panel and bellowing "WARNING! WARNING! DANGER!" at
         the top of its not inconsiderable voice. It rolls on out of sight, and
         moments later there is an immense flash of light and a tremendous blast
         of sparks and smoke. When the air clears, you find that no trace
         remains of the strange apparition.
TEXT
         With a sudden gust of air, a large cave bat flutters into view, flies
         around your head several times, squeaks with disgust, and flutters on
         out of sight.
TEXT
         Suddenly, the ground quivers underfoot; a dull rumbling sound resounds
         from the rock around you, and in the distance you can hear the crash of
         falling rock. The earth tremor subsides after a few seconds without
         causing any major damage.
TEXT
         From the darkness nearby comes the sound of shuffling feet. As you
         turn towards the sound, a nine-foot cyclops ambles into the light of
         your lamp. The cyclops is dressed in a three-piece suit of worsted
         wool, and is wearing a black silk top-hat and cowboy boots and is
         carrying an ebony walking-stick. It catches sight of you and stops,
         seeming frozen in its tracks, with its bloodshot eye bulging in
         amazement and its fang-filled jaw drooping with shock. After staring
         at you in incredulous disbelief for a few moments, it reaches into the
         pocket of its vest and pulls out a small plastic bag filled with a
         leafy green substance, and examines it carefully. "It must be worth
         eighty pazools an ounce after all" mumbles the cyclops, who casts one
         final look at you, shudders, and staggers away out of sight.
TEXT
         From somewhere in the distance comes a heart-wrenching scream of mortal
         terror! "NO! DON'T! NO! NO! HELP!!!!" cries the voice, and then
         lets out a wail of agony that is cut off abruptly. Subdued crunching
         and slurping sounds can be heard for a minute or so, and then silence
         falls.
TEXT
         All of the sudden, into the light of your lamp walks a procession of
         little men in green suits and green top hats. In front of the
         procession, six of them carry a tiny coffin. Sombre chords of a
         funeral march seem to be hovering in the air on the verge of
         audibility, but as you strain your ears, the only sound you can hear is
         the shuffling of little feet. The procession passes by you, without in
         any way acknowledging your presence, and disappears round a corner.
TEXT
         A sepulchral voice suddenly reverberates through the cave:

         "Ralph Witt to the Main Office please! Ralph Witt to the Main Office!"

TEXT     LAST.CAMEO
         From somewhere nearby come the sounds of sliding, stumbling feet. As
         you turn towards them, the beam of your lamp falls upon a tall,
         shambling figure approaching you out of the darkness. Standing no more
         than five feet tall, it cannot possibly weigh more than fifty pounds
         including the shroud and bandages in which it is wrapped; a musty reek
         like the scent of old, dead earth seeps from it and fills the air. As
         you cower back in disgust and horror, the figure halts, examines you
         through eyes resembling wet pebbles, and whispers "Peace, man!" in a
         voice like wind rustling through dead trees. It then turns and
         shambles away into the darkness.

         partly open and behind it you can see a party of dwarves playing
         pinochle on a large oblong table amidst a chaos of dirty dishes, pewter
         mugs and sizable earthenware jugs. A large nasty looking dwarf is
         snoring on a stool by the door, resting his unshaven chin on the shaft
         of a long sharp axe. As you clear the last step, the dwarf suddenly
         opens his eyes, blinks in surprise, jumps up and with a single neat
         swing of the axe takes your head off.

         As the top landing comes into view, you can see on it two large nasty

         weak, for the wicked dwarves have stolen the Ring of Orion and have
         hidden it deep in the Land of Mists, where I cannot go. Return the

         A distant roll of thunder drowns the voice, and as the woman fades from
         a cloud of smoke steps a horned creature with a pointed tail. "If you
         have anything more to do with that wisp," he says "you will find
         yourself in infernal hot water. Just you stick to pilfering a few
         treasures and you won't come to much harm!" With that he points to the

         disappears.

         tunnel walls, unicorn and everything disappear and you fly on in pitch
         blackness. Far below you a door opens, revealing a dull red glow, and
         grotesque figures pour forth and dance and sway as you fall towards the
         aperture. Your descent is impeded, slowly at first and then more
         firmly, by a web of gossamer threads, on which you can clearly see
         stamped at intervals "Made in Fairyland." Below you the creatures
         leap, but try as they might they cannot reach you until there appears
         our horned fiend. "You chose the losing side my friend!" he says and
         slashes through the supporting threads. As you fall you hear his evil
         laugh and him shout "Welcome to Hell!".

         Now you really are in a mess. People like you didn't ought to be
         allowed in the cave, poking your nose into things you can't handle.

         You can't fly or jump across the lava, but you might get across by
         using magic.". Then he hops from foot to foot chuckling to himself and
         disappears into the gloom just as suddenly as he came.
TEXT
         Suddenly, you become aware of a little figure standing quite still
         in the shadows just outside the reach of your lamp. He is studying you
         intently and after a moment turns away and disappears muttering to
         himself "Don't they teach them ANYTHING about pentagrams nowadays?..."

         Without any warning a deep voice says behind you "Consider the Orb,
         my friend, consider the Orb...". Startled, you turn around only
         to glimpse a small figure disappearing into the darkness.
TEXT
         Without any warning a little figure steps into the light of your lamp.
         He considers you thoughtfully, opens his mouth, shuts it again, shakes
         his head and scurries off into the gloom.

         A little figure suddenly jumps out of the shadows. He pirouettes on
         one foot and says in an unexpectedly deep voice: "Starstones are
         both useful and valuable if used with care, though how they manage
         that little trick of theirs, I really don't know...". Than he suddenly
         points behind you and shouts "Ha!". Startled you turn around but can
         see nothing unusual. When you look back, the little man is gone without
         a trace.

         All you can make out is "... dark ... mutter ... Thomas Alva ...

         to track down the source, the sound dies away.

         appeared.

         A little figure suddenly steps out of the shadows. He lifts a finger
         to his lips and whispers in a deep voice: "Shhhh.... Don't tell
         anybody, but of the keys, there are... er... ah....". He snaps his
         fingers, pulls his ear thoughtfully and then with a rueful shake of
         head and a sigh of "...damn memory..." quickly shuffles off.
TEXT
         A small figure suddenly pops out of the gloom in front of you. He

TEXT     STARSTONE.FALLS
         As it falls, the starstone emits a short flash of blue light and for
         a brief moment becomes curiously unfocused.
TEXT     DARK.STARSTONE
         As it falls, the starstone emits a brief flash of blue light.
TEXT     DRACHMA.DROPS
         The machine shudders violently and after much clanking and clicking
         spits out a small bronze coin; a drachma, by the looks of it.

TEXT     SWAPPED.EM
         Hang on... OK, I've swapped them.
TEXT     OH.NO.YOU.DONT!
         As you lift the chalice to your lips, there is a sharp plop and a horned
         creature with a pointed tail hurriedly steps out of an evil smelling
         cloud of smoke. "Oh no you don't!..." he says and points at the chalice
         which crumples to dust in your hands. The creature gives you a sardonic
         salute, screws its tail into a tight spiral and disappears in a dazzling
         shower of multicoloured sparks.
TEXT     BUZZ.OFF

         "OI!" says the giant, "YOU'VE HAD YOUR REWARD. BUZZ OFF!". With these
         words he pushes you, not ungently, back into the ravine.

TEXT     POLISH.PLATE
         It is a hard work, but as you # the plate its surface gradually
         gets smooth and shiny.
TEXT     DWARVES.UPSET
         The horn emits a surprisingly full and mellow note. Inspite of its
         undeniable musical qualities, the sound seems to further aggravate
         the already agitated dwar[/f/ves].
TEXT     DRAIN.TOO.SMALL
         Would you perhaps care to explain how you propose to squeeze through
         a ten inch drain? Be serious!
TEXT     CHASE.GIANT
         "OI!..." begins the giant in an unfriendly tone of voice, but before
         he can get any further, a large pinkish cloud condenses nearby.
         A mouth and a pair of dark eyes shape themselves in the cloud and
         the familiar deep voice booms out: "IT COMES TO ME, OH MORTAL,
         THAT I HAD FORGOTTEN TO MENTION ONE PROPERTY OF THE MAGIC WORD OF
         MY AUNT'S. SHE USED TO CLAIM, ALWAYS WITH A CHUCKLE, THAT IT SHOULD
         HAVE A MOST INTERESTING EFFECT UPON GIANTS..."

         At these words the giant visibly blanches and hurriedly begins to
         collect his possessions, muttering anxiously "OUKAY... OUKAY...
         NO NEE' TO GEE' NASTY... ALL I WANTS IS A BIT O' PEACE FOR ME
         CALLIBRATION...". Having collected the lot into a large untidy
         bundle he sticks the crate of champagne under his arm and, with a
         nasty glance in the djinn's direction, climbs (I would not have
         believed it possible!) over the edge of the enclosure and disappears
         from the view. The cloud gives you a merry wink, and with a loud
         belch leasurly dissipates into thin air.
TEXT     NOT.ENOUGH

         You strike the mirror a resounding blow, whereupon it shatters into
         a myriad fragments. Viciosly sharp pieces of glass rain everywhere.
         You try to dodge, but are cut down by the flying debris.
TEXT     DWARVES.WAKE
         The resulting ruckus has awakened the dwarves. There are now several
         very angry little dwarves in here with you. Most of them throw knives
         at you! All of them hit you!!
TEXT     DWARF.WAKES
         You prod the nearest dwarf, who wakes up grumpily, takes one look at

         adventurer grandmaster!
TEXT     YOU.EXPLODE
         There is a loud explosion. Being foolishly near its epicentre, you
         suddenly find yourself splashed across the walls of the cave.
TEXT     LAVA.FLOWS
         There is a loud explosion at the other end of the repository and
         the far wall collapses, burying the snakes in the rubble. A river
         of molten lava pours in through the hole, destroying everything in
         its path, including you. (Not even cinders remain!).
TEXT     KABOOM
         There is a loud explosion at the other end of the repository and
         a section of the far wall collapses, burying the dwarves in the
         rubble. The settling dust reveals a dark hole leading northeast.
         When the air is finally clear, a snow-white golden-horned unicorn
         walks out of the hole and, gracefully picking its way through the
         heaps of rubble, calmly approaches you.

TEXT     THROUGH.THE.MIRROR
         The unicorn neighs indignantly, rears up and suddenly leaps straight
         into the mirror. As you pass through the surface of the mirror,
         which curiously enough fails to shatter, you experience a sickening
         twisting sensation as if you were being turned inside out. Everything
         swims in front of your eyes, your arms weaken and you feel yourself
         slipping from the unicorn's back and falling... falling... falling...

         When you finally recover your senses, you find....
TEXT     OTHER.DWARVES.WAKE
         You kill the nearest dwarf. Unfortunately the ruckus has awakened
         other dwarves. There are now several bloodthirsty little dwarves in
         here with you. All of them throw knives at you. All of them get you.
TEXT     IS.DUTCH

         You'd be amazed, though, how many adventuring slobs think otherwise.
TEXT     CHEST.LOCKED
         Unfortunately, the chest has a combination lock on it. Still, it is

TEXT     TREASURE.2

         The floor is covered with thick layers of precious Persian rugs!

         Rare coins, bars of silver, and lumps of gold and platinum are strewn
         carelessly about!

         There are diamonds, rubies, sapphires, emeralds, opals, pearls, and
         fabulous sculptures and ornaments carved out of jade and imperishable
         crystal resting on display shelves, along with rare Ming vases and
         ancient Indian turquoise beads!

         A flotilla of ruby-encrusted toy boats is floating in the pool of water
         beside you!

         A network of golden chains supports a fantastic Iridium crown!
         There is a display case on the wall filled with a mind-boggling
         collection of magical swords, which are singing "Hail to the Chief"
         in perfect multivoice harmony.

TEXT     TREASURE.3

         A multitude of friendly elves raise from tables prepared for a

         A multitude of elves raise from tables laden with a mouth-watering

         It is time for this your humble servant to take leave of you in your
         moment of glory. It has been a pleasure and a privilege to be your

TEXT     BACK.TO.REALITY
         The syllables of the word seem to reverberate through the vastness

         with, the grayness about you begins to coalesce into new (or is it
         old?) shapes and meanings. Finally you find...

TEXT     EYE.STRAIN
         As you consider the orb, it appears to expand, quickly filling your

         depth. Straining your eyes after the uncertain forms you begin to see
TEXT     ORB.VISIONS
         spiraling showers of pale yet fiery multicoloured sparks.
TEXT
         a pattern of green patches, which slowly clarifies itself into a small
         plant growing at the bottom of a dark pit.
TEXT
         billowing clouds of pale colours, which gradually resolve into a giant
         hungrily chewing his dirty fingernails.
TEXT
         a storm of jet-black snowflakes, which gradually dissolves into a most
         terrifying giant spider crouching in the corner of a huge web. The
         darkness above the web is pulsing in a motion suggestive of the beat of
         a pair of enormous wings.
TEXT
         a swirl of white mists. Through it, uncertain at first but gradually
         getting clearer, comes the image of a gleaming sword firmly embedded
         in a slab of rock.
TEXT
         a pair of unfriendly eyes staring at you from darkness. Very slowly the
         image gets brighter, and gradually the ugly face of an ogre comes into
         full view.
TEXT
         a swirling shower of gold and silver sparks. As you watch, mesmerised
         by the intricate patterns of their dance, the sparks gather into a
         circular band of light, which slowly contracts into a gleaming mithril
         ring.
TEXT
         an intense red glow filled with clouds of dark smoke. Far below, an
         incandescent river of fire can be glimpsed through breaks in the billowing
         smoke.
TEXT
         the head of a minotaur thoughtfully staring back at you.
TEXT
         a swirl of darkness. Gradually a core of light develops in its centre,
         revealing the unearthly vision of a snake-like skeleton entwined with
         a peculiar metal contraption. Strangly, the image suggest hollow,
         chambering echoes, as if from a complex network of passages surrounding
         the place.
TEXT
         a rose-coloured glow, which slowly contracts into the image of a huge
         crown floating in mid-air.
TEXT     END.VISION

         After a few moments the vision fades, leaving you somewhat giddy and

         Well, as an honest, hard working sprite I naturally would not know

         quite a few other more or less useful words - some of them for use by
         wizards and none of your business.

         First, the verbs. I've included here some words which are not verbs in
         the strict grammatical meaning of the word, but which are nonetheless
         acted upon as such (e.g. 'terse').

         Verbs: 
        /       blast, break, brief, change, climb, close (lock), cross, cut,
        /       dig, drink, drop (DR, free), eat, enter (in), exit (out),
        /       extinguish (off), feed, fill, go (walk, run), get (G, take, T),
        /       help (?), history, hit, hoot, info, inventory (I), jump, kill,
        /       lift, light (on), listen, look (L, examine, X), news, open
        /       (unlock), play, pour, quit (Q), read, reflect, remove, rest,
        /       restore, retreat (back), ride, rub (polish), save, say, score
        /       (SC), scry, tame (placate), terse, throw (TH), translate,
        /       verbose, vocabulary, wash, wave (swing), wear.
TEXT
         Next come nouns. These describe things and beings you can sensibly
         refer to and may (or may not) be able to manipulate.

         Nouns: 
        /       axe, bag, basilisk, batteries, beads, bear, bird, bones,
        /       bottle, bracelet, cage, chain, chalice, chasm, chest
        /       (treasure), clam, coins, crown, crucifix, curtains, diamonds,
        /       dinghy, djinn, documents, door, drachma, dragon, drain,
        /       drawings, dung, dwarf (dwarves), eggs (nest), emerald, fish,
        /       flask, fog, food, gate, giant, goblins, gold (nugget), gong,
        /       grate, grill, helmet, horn, inscription, jewelry, keys, lamp,
        /       machine (vending), magazine (Spelunker), mirror, mist,
        /       mushroom, notice, ogre, oil, opals (casket), orb (globe), owl,
        /       pearl, pillow, pirate, plant (beanstalk), plaque, plate,
        /       portcullis, pottery (shards), pyramid, rags, rat, ring, rod,
        /       rope, rug, safe, sapphire, sceptre, sculpture, silver (bars),
        /       skeleton, slime, snake, spices, spider, spoon, spyglass,
        /       stalactite, starstone, statue, steps, sword, tablet, teeth,
        /       throne, tortoise, tree, trident, troll, tusk, unicorn, vase,
        /       vial, water, web, yacht.
TEXT     VOCAB.LAST
         Finally, the directions and some travel options.

         Directions: 
        /            north (N), northeast (NE), east (E), southeast (SE),
        /            south (S), southwest (SW), west (W), northwest (NW),
        /            up (U) and down (D), downstream, upstream.

         Travel options are special words, like BUILDING, which allow you
         to travel some distance in one move. Naturally, they only work in
         a few restricted places. Just where, you will have to discover for
         yourself.

         Travel options: 
        /                barren, bedquilt, building, depression, fork, pit,
        /                secret, view, ...

         I am myself unsure of the complete list. There may be others.

         Into view there bounces a horrible creature!! Six feet across, it
         resembles a large blob of translucent white jelly;  although it looks
         massive, it is bouncing lightly up and down as though it were as light
         as a feather. It is emitting a constant throbbing sound, and it
         \>ROAR\<s loudly as it sees you.

TEXT
         There is an immense and unfriendly-looking blob in the room with you!

TEXT
         The blob \>ROAR\<s triumphantly and bounces straight at you with amazing
         speed, crushing you to the ground and cutting off your air supply
         with its body. You quickly suffocate.
TEXT     DELICATE.STRUCTURE
         An excuisitely delicate structure. Looks like Bohemian crystal, but you
         never know nowadays, it might be plastic. I dare say it is safe enough,

         A bit melodramatic, perhaps. One of my creators thought things were

         You have nothing suitable for #ing the plate.
TEXT     FRAGILE.ARCH
         It arches gracefully over the lava gorge, which bubbles and spits
         below. The near section looks a bit fragile, but probably solid enough
         to support your weight. As for the rest of it... who knows? The
         top of the arch is shrouded in fumes and the further end is too
         distorted by the intervening mass of hot air to be able to make out
         any details.
TEXT     DISTANT.STREAMBED
         The bottom of the streambed is shrouded in darkness and the way down
         looks very treacherous indeed.
TEXT     CLIMBING.OUT.RISKY
         Climbing out of windows can be very dangerous. In this game it is also
         quite pointless.
TEXT     RUG.NOT.FOR.FLYING
         The rug is a very fine one, but there is nothing magical about it, so
         you can forget any notions of using it for effortless whizzing about.
TEXT     FOREST.TOO.DENSE
         The forest in that direction is too dense to fight your way through.
TEXT     EXPANSIONS.START
         Ok, here are the expansion areas grouped (and repeated) according to
         the version of Adventure you may have encountered. Not all expansions
         are important (though most definitely are) and some may be less than
         immediately obvious. You will also find other changes and additions here
         and there, but this lot should be quite sufficient to get you going.

         If you only know the original Adventure, you should explore around the
         Antechamber, the Reservoir, the South Side Chamber, the Breathtaking
         View, the Giant Room, the Hall of the Mountain King, the Arched Hall
         and around the building.

         Adventure II devotees should visit the Breathtaking View, the Giant
         Room, the Hall of the Mountain King, the Arched Hall and Above Chapel.
         Exploring above ground is also recommended.
TEXT     EXPANSIONS.END
         Adventure 550 (or Adventure3) players will find changes in the South
         Side Chamber, the Anteroom, the Reservoir, the Lava Tube and above
         ground. There are also noteworthy changes (though no actual expansion)
         in the Toolroom and in the Catacombs.

         All players should read carefully through the text provided by INFO and
         the 'vanilla flavoured' HELP. Both have been substantially modified.

         Now go forth and enjoy yourself!...

         You drop the cage, and the bird in it, into the niche.
TEXT     NO.VALUE.BIRD
         You take the bird out of the cage and put it into the niche. The bird
         promptly flies out, lands on the floor and begins to sing.
TEXT     VASE.IN.NICHE
         You carefully drop the vase into the niche and it delicately shatters
         into tiny fragments.
TEXT     STARSTONE.IN.NICHE
         As you drop the starstone into the niche, it emits a short flash of
         blue light and for a brief moment becomes curiously unfocused.

         As you drop the starstone into the niche, it suddenly lights up with
         iridescent blue glow.
FRAGMENT VALUATION.IN.PROGRESS

         As you step back, a dark shiny cover slides noislessly out of the wall
         and closes the niche off. From behind it you can hear intermittent
         buzzing, hissing and whirring noises, occasionally accompanied by
         showers of sparks, dimly visible through the somewhat transparent
         cover. After a while the sounds stop and the cover snaps open releasing
         a strong smell of ozone and revealing the inside of the niche. A

         The niche is lit in some manner, although you cannot determine how.
         It is looks large enough to take any objects you might wish to drop
         in there. Curiously enough, while there is plenty of dust all around,
         none has accumulated in the niche itself.
TEXT     WELL.NO.CLIMB
         You clamber up the sides of the well and upon reaching the top find a
         stone slab blocking your ascent. You give the slab a push and it
         refuses to budge. You push some more, but it is no use. Swearing through
         your teeth you climb down again.

         You didn't *really* think this would work, now did you?
TEXT     BACK.TO.DUNGEON
         You push against the ceiling where you reckon the loose flagstone ought
         to be and it duly opens. You climb out through the opening, letting the

FRAGMENT SNAKE.HINT.2?
         Are you still trying to get past the snake?

         Well, it may be just a matter of emphasis. I said "You can't drive the

         Suppose it was "YOU can't"? Does it not suggest an alternative line
         of thought? It doesn't? Oh, don't tell me, let me guess - you've

         You bump your nose against a wall... again. As you rub it, swearing
         under your breath, you suddenly hear a quick staccatto of hoofs
         somewhere in the distance. The sound quickly dies away, leaving
         you with an uneasy feeling that you've just blown your chances of
         becoming an Adventurer Grandmaster.

         Well, don't tell me I didn't warn you.
TEXT     WELLHOUSE.YOU.DUMMY
         No, no... a misunderstanding. "Well house" does not imply a "well".
         It just means that the spring wells out within the house. There is no
         well to be seen here. I hope I am making myself clear enough for you.

         Water in this dungeon is provided primarily for quenching thirst.
         It does, of course, have other points, e.g. in its decorative

         You can't see the walls - they are covered by the curtains.

         The curtains are fixed near the ceiling and cannot be opened, but
         passage through may be possible, if there are any openings behind.

         The curtains are fixed somewhere above the other side of the opening,

TEXT     NO.WALLS
         As could be plainly inferred from the description by anybody with
         even a very modest amount of intelligence, this strange place has
         no such conventional features as walls. Before you ask, no, it
         has no floor, ceiling, doors or windows either. I hope, the
         fact does not come as a surprise.

         It is a small earthenware flask, sealed with red wax. The seal is worn

         of the Solomon's Seal imprinted into it. Or rather, you could if you

         iron strips. It is firmly locked and bound into place by a powerful
         spell for good measure. The notice obviosly means just what it says.
TEXT     DOOR.NOTICE
         It still says       "DWARVES STORES - NO ACCESS".
TEXT     REMOVE.IT.FIRST
         You'd have to remove the # first.
TEXT     WHISPERS.STOP
         You take the crown off.... and the whispering sound fades away.
TEXT     VOICES.STOP
         You remove the crown and the voices stop.
TEXT     CHANTING.STOPS
         You remove the crown and are greatly relieved to find that the
         chanting stops.
TEXT     ROAR.STOPS
         You snatch the crown off your head. Your ears still ring for a
         while with the echo of the roar, but the sound itself is gone.
TEXT     JUST.IN.TIME
         You tear the crown off your head - none too soon I would say - and
         spend a while just sitting on the floor, fighting nausea and trying
         to forget the frightening impact of the roaring chant. Finally you
         get up, a bit shakily perhaps, ready to continue your explorations.
TEXT     CROWN.SOFT
         You strain your ears...
TEXT     CROWN.LOUD
         You pause and listen...
TEXT     DEBRIS.NOTE
         It still says "Magic word XYZZY". What did you expect?
TEXT     NUGGET.ROOM.NOTE
         It says the same as before: "[You/Ok, YOU] won't get[ it/] up
         the steps[/!]". Too true, if you ask me.
TEXT     VALUERS.NOTE
         It still reads "Drop your objects here for a free valuation".
TEXT     FLAGSTONE.INFO
         The large flagstones covering the floor look old and pretty solid.
         They fit tightly together, but one seems to rock a bit under your
         probing hand.
TEXT     VOICES

         You suddenly realise that the voices are gone.
TEXT

         You can hear a soft whispering sound somewhere nearby.
TEXT

         A whispering sound wafts around you.
TEXT

         A sound like that of several whispering voices seems to be lingering
         in the air.
TEXT

         Soft voices seem to whisper something quietly into your ears.
TEXT

         Whispering voices swirl about you. If you listen carefully, you could
         almost make out some words...
TEXT

         You are surrounded by the sound of murmuring voices. All you can
         make out is "... the keys......... the keys......... the keys....".
TEXT

         A chorus of soft voices murmurs into your ears
        =              "... four....... four....... four....... four..."
TEXT

         A soft voice startles you by saying very clearly and distinctly

        =              "Of the keys, there are FOUR..."
TEXT

         One of the voices begins to chant

        =              "Blerbi, Blerbi, Blerbi...."
TEXT

         The first voice gets gradually louder and is soon joined by another,
         chanting

        =              "Klaetu, Klaetu, Klaetu..."
TEXT

         Now three ghostly voices clamour in your ears chanting:

        =         Blerbi                KNERL        KNERL
        =   Klaetu        KNERL    Blerbi      Blerbi     Klaetu
        =       KNERL           Klaetu     Blerbi      Klaetu      KNERL
        =               Blerbi                    KNERL

         Strangely enough, your hearing is not at all affected by the ghostly
         din.
TEXT

         As the chanting becomes louder and louder, a fourth voice can be heard
         in the chaotic chant:

        =                         SNOEZE          SNOEZE...
        =                                 SNOEZE
TEXT

         You are surrounded by a chaos of disembodied voices chanting
        =
        =     KNERL          SNOEZE     BLERBI          KNERL
        =         KLAETU               SNOEZE      BLERBI       BLERBI
        = KNERL      SNOEZE      BLERBI                KLAETU
        =        BLERBI                     KNERL              SNOEZE
        =                 KLAETU    KLAETU         SNOEZE             BLERBI
        =     KLAETU           SNOEZE                      KNERL
TEXT

         The chant is swiftly turning into a disturbingly loud roar and it
         is beginning to be difficult to distinguish the individual words.
         You try to block your ears, but it is no good, the sound is really
         in your mind.
TEXT

         The ghostly chanting is rapidly becoming intolerably loud. It is no
         longer possible to distinguish in it any words, but its shifting
         rythm beats against your mind with the ferocity of a hurricane.
TEXT

         You feel surrounded by a roaring sea of sounds, rippling with crossbeats
         and crescendoes of the chant. The volume is increasing steadily and you
         can feel your sanity wavering under the assault of the sound.
TEXT

         The roar of voices in your head raises to an impossible crescendo.
         In the last flash of sanity, you attempt to claw the crown off your
         head, but it is too late - the darkness envelops you as your mind
         is torn to shreds by the triumphant voices, swirling in for the kill.
TEXT     ITS.A.WINDOW
         It's a window - a hole in the wall, if you pardon such a vulgar, though
         apt, description. No glazing. Civilization has not reached this far yet.
TEXT     NO.GLASS
         The window is just a hole in the wall. There is nothing in it to #.
TEXT     SPLASHING.NOISES
         You pause for a while and listen to the splashing sounds.
TEXT     HOUSE.INFO
         It's no architectural miracle - just a simple brick structure with no
         windows, serving as a well house for a large spring.
TEXT     SLAB.INFO
         A massive hunk of stone. Nothing particularly special about it.
TEXT     HEELPRINT.INFO
         You examine the heelprint-like indentation and find nothing of interest.

         _Nobody waves back. Amazing, isn't it?
TEXT     THIS.WAY.OUT
         There is no "#" here. Just insubstantial glowing letters
         hanging in mid-air. They spell "This way out", just as they did
         the last time you looked.
TEXT     NO.KILL.DARWIN
         Darwin blinks in surprise, but being used to all sorts of customers
         simply blows a few bubbles and sinks back into the depths of the lake.
TEXT     MAZE.HELP.OFFER
         Well, this is strictly against the rules, but if you are really desperate
         I can get you out of here. It'll cost you, of course. The standard charge
         is # points anyway, but on top of that you'd have to leave here any
         valuables you happen to carry.

TEXT     MAZE.HELP.NO.OFFER
         Sorry, you are an experienced enough player to be able to find your own
         way round mazes.
TEXT     CLEAN.NOW
         You splosh some water on your face and discover that it is not really
         all that cold. Somewhat encouraged, you strip off and climb into the
         stream. (Don't worry, I am not looking - I know this bit by heart).
         Curiously enough, the water now feels quite warm and a bit soapy. You
         scrub yourself and give your posessions a proper rinse. As you climb out
         again, a hot breeze springs out of nowhere in particular and quickly
         dries you off. You put on your clothes, also quite dry by now, and feel
         cleaner than you have been for ages. Magic, ain't it?
TEXT     IN.THIS.MUCK?
         In case you haven't noticed, you are wading through some pretty mucky
         sewage. If you are trying to catch cholera, I can assure you there are
         much quicker ways of commiting suicide around here.
TEXT     CLEAN.ENOUGH
         You splosh some water on your face, but it is bitterly cold and you
         quickly decide that you are quite clean enough as you are.
TEXT     NO.WASTE.WATER
         Personal hygiene is all very well, but only a B-movie adventurer would be
         daft enough to waste his meagre water supply for the sake of appearances.

         Well, I do confess I have been leading you round in circles. For
         your own protection, really, or the dwarves might object rather
         strongly, as you must realise. They have been known to take some
         pretty drastic measures on past occasions.
TEXT     WHATEVER.FOR?
         Whatever for? There's no profit in it.
TEXT     RAGS.DIRTY
         Don't bother. Nothing in the world is going to make those tatty things
         look any better - short of a Fairy Godmother that is, and hardened
         adventurers aren't supposed to believe in fairies.

TEXT     SUICIDE.SILLY
         Oh, come, come! Things aren't really that bad. Try to think
         positively! You know, the "Every day in every way I feel

         always quit. Wouldn't it be nice if all life's problems could

         Well, I don't know.... Somehow I don't think the Powers That Be
         would approve. A violent death or two, or an accident here and
         there, that's one thing, but suicide is something else. Could
         be altogether bad for the business. You know what? Why don't
         you just try walking about without a light? Just don't tell
         anybody it was my idea, there's a good fellow!
TEXT     FAKE.AN.ACCIDENT
         Oh, come on! I don't have to tell you again how to fake an
         accident, do I? One can't help noticing that your intellectual
         capacity is nothing to brag about, but even that pea-size
         brainlet of yours should be able to retain sound advice a bit
         longer than that!

TEXT     DROP.RUG.FIRST
         Even an adventurer of little brain should realise that if a rug
         is too large to be picked up unrolled, then it may be a good idea
         to drop it before unrolling it again. Let's see how your brain
         measures up.
TEXT     I.SAY.DROP.RUG.FIRST
         I say, drop the rug first, Oh Adventurer of Little Brain.
TEXT     RUG.TOO.LARGE
         The rug is too large to be picked up like that. [Yawn.../

         Well, all right. The portcullis is now oily as well as rusty. I

TEXT     SPOON.STILL.TARNISHED
         You rub the spoon, and it becomes marginally cleaner, but not

         Trying to pick up fully grown bears can be detrimental to one's

TEXT     ALREADY.GOT.BEAR
         It is not necessary to carry bears in this game. You'll have

         You politely indicate to the bear that you no longer desire its

         I can understand the sight of the flask clouding your wits, but
         in order to sample its contents, it just might be useful to
         open the flask first.
TEXT     NO.OIL.SWORD
         Such care of your weapon is commendable and would be doubtless
         suitably rewarded by a dilligent AD&D Dungeon Master, but this 
         is not an RPG and due to its magical nature, the sword does not
         require your ministrations.
