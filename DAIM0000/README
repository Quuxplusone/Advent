This is Daimler's 350-point "Adventure" (circa June 1990, according
to Russel Dalenberg). Its version information lists
    
        -Conversion to BDS  C by J. R. Jaeger
        -Unix standardization by Jerry D. Pohl.
        -OS/2 Conversion by Martin Heller
        -Conversion to TurboC 2.0 by Daimler
    
It contains Jerry Pohl's original ADVENT.DOC (dated 12 JUNE 1984),
plus comments from Martin Heller (dated 30-Aug-1988). Strangely for
an expansion, Daimler's version actually introduces a number of typos
into the data files, and disables a handful of inessential verbs
(READ, EAT, FILL) with the comment that there is "no room" for them
(presumably in the PC's limited memory).
