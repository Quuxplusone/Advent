1       Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in
1       treasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never
1       seen again.  Magic is said to work in the cave.  I will be your eyes
1       and hands.  Direct me with natural English commands.  I should warn
1       you that I look at only the first five letters of each word, so you'll
1       have to enter "Northeast" as "NE" to distinguish it from "North".
1       (Should you get stuck, type "HELP" or "?" for some general hints.)
1       Good Luck!
1       - - - -
2       A little dwarf with a big knife blocks your way.
3       A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you, threw a little
3       axe at you which missed, cursed, and ran away.
4       There is a threatening little dwarf in the room with you!
5       One sharp nasty knife is thrown at you!
6       None of them hit you!
7       One of them gets you!
8       A hollow voice says "Plugh".
9       There is no way to go that direction.
10      I am unsure how you are facing.  Use compass points or nearby objects.
11      I don't know in from out here.  Use compass points or name something
11      in the general direction you want to go.
12      I don't know how to apply that word here.
13      I don't understand that!
14      I'm game.  Would you care to explain how?
15      Sorry, but I am not allowed to give more detail.  I will repeat the
15      long description of your location.
16      It is now pitch dark.  If you proceed you will likely fall into a pit.
17      If you prefer, simply type "W" rather than "West".
18      Are you trying to catch the bird?
19      The bird is frightened right now and you cannot catch it no matter
19      what you try.  Perhaps you might try later.
20      Are you trying to somehow deal with the snake?
21      You can't kill the snake, or drive it away, or avoid it, or anything
21      like that.  There is a way to get by, but you don't have the necessary
21      resources right now.
22      Do you really want to quit now?
23      You fell into a pit and broke every bone in your body!
24      You are already carrying it!
25      You can't be serious!
26      The bird was unafraid when you entered, but as you approach it becomes
26      disturbed and you cannot catch it.
27      You can catch the bird, but you cannot carry it.
28      There is nothing here with a lock!
29      You aren't carrying it!
30      The little bird attacks the green snake, and in an astounding flurry
30      drives the snake away.
31      You have no keys!
32      It has no lock.
33      I don't know how to lock or unlock such a thing.
34      It was already locked.
35      The grate is now locked.
36      The grate is now unlocked.
37      It was already unlocked.
38      You have no source of light.
39      Your lamp is now on.
40      Your lamp is now off.
41      There is no way to get past the bear to unlock the chain, which is
41      probably just as well.
42      Nothing happens.
43      Where?
44      There is nothing here to attack.
45      The little bird is now dead.  Its body disappears.
46      Attacking the snake both doesn't work and is very dangerous.
47      You killed a little dwarf.
48      You attack a little dwarf, but he dodges out of the way.
49      With what?  Your bare hands?
50      Good try, but that is an old worn-out magic word.
51      I know of places, actions, and things.  Much of my vocabulary
51      describes places and is used to move you there.  To move, try words
51      like forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west, north, south,
51      up, or down.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod
51      hidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of
51      the action words that I know.  Usually you will need to give both the
51      object and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can infer
51      the object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in
51      particular, "INVENTORY" implies "TAKE INVENTORY", which causes me to
51      give you a list of what you're carrying.  The objects have side
51      effects; for instance, the rod scares the bird.  Usually people having
51      trouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Usually people
51      trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something
51      beyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely
51      different tack.  To speed the game you can sometimes move long
51      distances with a single word.  For example, "Building" usually gets
51      you to the building from anywhere above ground except when lost in the
51      forest or the marsh.  Also, note that cave passages turn a lot, and
51      that leaving a room to the north does not guarantee entering the
51      next from the south.  You'd best make yourself a map as you go along.

51      A word about my understanding of English -- I will try very hard to
51      do whatever you say, but here are a few suggestions.  To scarf up
51      everything movable at a given location, say 'TAKE EVERYTHING' or
51      'TAKE ALL'.  Some objects may be differentiated only by some attribute
51      or other.  For example, if you were holding both a red and a blue
51      frammitz, you would have to distinguish between them by typing
51      'RED FRAMMITZ' or 'BLUE FRAMMITZ' so that I'll know which one you
51      mean.   Also, you can specify several actions or objects by using
51      commas or 'AND', as 'TAKE ABC,DEF AND XYZ AND BURN WITCH'.

51      - - -
51      To list what you are currently holding, say "INVENTORY", or just "I".
51      - - -
51      To reprint the detailed description of where you are, say "LOOK"
51      or "L".  You can also "LOOK IN" or "LOOK AT" appropriate objects.

51      If you want to end your adventure early, say "QUIT".
51      - - -
51      To suspend your adventure such that you can continue later,
51      say "SUSPEND" (or "PAUSE" or "SAVE").
51      - - -
51      To see what hours the cave is normally open, say "HOURS".
51      - - -
51      To see how well you're doing, say "SCORE".  To get full credit for a
51      treasure, you must have left it safely in the building, though you get
51      partial credit just for locating it.  Note that leaving something
51      in a *safe* place may be trickier than you think!
51      You lose points for getting killed, or for quitting,
51      though the former costs you more.  There are also points
51      based on how much (if any) of the cave you've managed to
51      explore; in particular, there is a large bonus just for getting in (to
51      distinguish the dilletantes from the rest of the pack), and there are
51      other ways to determine whether you've been through some of the more
51      harrowing sections.  If you think you've found all the treasures, just
51      keep exploring for a while.  If nothing interesting happens, you
51      haven't found them all yet.  If something interesting *DOES* happen,
51      it means you're getting a bonus and have an opportunity to garner many
51      more points in the Master's Section.  I may occasionally offer hints
51      if you seem to be having trouble.  If I do, I'll warn you in advance
51      how much it will affect your score to accept the hints.

51      In addition to getting yourself killed, you can also be wounded or
51      injured in various (non-lethal) ways.  If you get burnt, poisoned,
51      electrocuted or whatever, you can check on your current state of
51      health by typing 'HEALTH' or 'DIAGNOSE'.  Note that recuperation
51      takes place faster outside in the fresh air!

51      This an exceedingly complex program and it's possible that something
51      may interact with something else in an unforseen way.  If you run
51      into something you think may be a program bug, or if you have any
51      ideas for extensions to the cave, type "GRIPE" (or "REPORT" or
51      "BITCH") and then enter as long a message as you like.  This will
51      be immediately transmitted to the Wizard, who will try to reply
51      within a day or two.

51      Finally, to save paper, you may specify "BRIEF", which tells me
51      never to repeat the full description of a place unless you explicitly
51      ask me to.  Experienced players may suppress *all* long-form
51      descriptions by typing "TERSE".  You can return to normal description
51      mode by typing "UNBRIEF" or "UNTERSE".
