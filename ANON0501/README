I know nothing about the history of this particular version of
adventure, although the submitter claims that it is the original
FORTRAN version.

There are no copyright notices in any of the code and there is no
author information either. I have not tried to compile this, but it
has been around long enough that it shouldn't be a problem as long
as you have a fortran compiler that understands this syntax. Note that
there may be system specific routines (e.g., SRCH$$(), SAVE$$()) that
would need to be renamed.

The .f.alt files are ones that someone used at onetime to disable
gripe and log messages and the wizard monitor.

P.S. Be sure to combine all three parts of main.f (main.f.1, main.f.2,
main.f.3) into a single main.f file and to combine the three parts of
the data file (adv.data.1, adv.data.2, adv.data.3) into a single
adv.data file.

P.P.S. As an exercise to the reader, one is welcome to convert this
to C using the f2c translator and submit the results for posting.
