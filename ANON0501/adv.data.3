52      It misses!
53      It gets you!
54      Ok
55      You can't unlock the keys.
56      You have crawled around in some little holes and wound up back in the
56      main passage.
57      I don't know where the cave is, but hereabouts no stream can run on
57      the surface for long.  I would try the stream.
58      I need more detailed instructions to do that.
59      I can only tell you what you see as you move about and manipulate
59      things.  I cannot tell you where remote things are.
60      I can't make any sense out of that.
61      What?
62      Are you trying to get into the cave?
63      The grate is very solid and has a hardened steel lock.  You cannot
63      enter without a key, and there are no keys nearby.  I would recommend
63      looking elsewhere for the keys.
64      The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple, with an
64      occasional grove of pine or spruce.  There is quite a bit of under-
64      growth, largely birch and ash saplings plus nondescript bushes of
64      various sorts.  This time of year visibility is quite restricted by
64      all the leaves, but travel is quite easy if you detour around the
64      spruce and berry bushes.
65      Welcome to ADVENTURE!!  Would you like instructions?
66      Digging without a shovel is quite impractical.  Even with a shovel
66      progress is unlikely.
67      Blasting requires dynamite.
68      I'm as confused as you are.
69      Mist is a white vapor, usually water, seen from time to time in
69      caverns.  It can be found anywhere but is frequently a sign of a deep
69      pit leading down to water.
70      Your feet are now wet.
71      I think I just lost my appetite.
72      Thank you, it was delicious!
73      You have taken a drink from the stream.  The water tastes strongly of
73      minerals, but is not unpleasant.  It is extremely cold.
74      The bottle is now empty.
75      Rubbing the electric lamp is not particularly rewarding.  Anyway,
75      nothing exciting happens.
76      Peculiar.  Nothing unexpected happens.
77      Your bottle is empty and the ground is wet.
78      You can't pour that.
79      Watch it!
80      Which way?
81      Oh dear, you seem to have gotten yourself killed.  I might be able to
81      help you out, but I've never really done this before.  Do you want me
81      to try to reincarnate you?
82      All right.  But don't blame me if something goes wr......
82      *                    --- POOF!! ---                    *
82      You are engulfed in a cloud of orange smoke.  Coughing and gasping,
82      you emerge from the smoke and find....
83      You clumsy oaf, you've done it again!  I don't know how long I can
83      keep this up.  Do you want me to try reincarnating you again?
84      Okay, now where did I put my orange smoke?....  >POOF!<
84      Everything disappears in a dense cloud of orange smoke.
85      Now you've really done it!  I'm out of orange smoke!  You don't expect
85      me to do a decent reincarnation without any orange smoke, do you?
86      Okay, if you're so smart, do it yourself!  I'm leaving!
90      >>> Messages 81 thru 90 are reserved for "Obituaries". <<<
91      Sorry, but I no longer seem to remember how it was you got here.
92      It's too heavy.  You'll have to drop something first.
93      You can't go through a locked steel grate!
94      I believe what you want is right here with you.
95      You don't fit through a two-inch slit!
96      I respectfully suggest you go across the bridge instead of jumping.
97      There is no way across the fissure.
98      You're not carrying anything.
99      You are currently holding the following:
100     It's not hungry (it's merely pinin' for the fjords).  Besides, you
100     have no bird seed.
101     The snake has now devoured your bird.
102     There's nothing here it wants to eat (except perhaps you).
103     You fool, dwarves eat only coal!  Now you've made him *REALLY* mad!!
104     Your cask is empty and the ground is soaked.
105     You aren't carrying them!
106     I don't need to, thank you.
107     The ground is wet and the air is smelly.
108     Your lamp is now on, but the glare from the walls is absolutely
108     blinding.  If you proceed you are likely to fall into a pit.
109     You haven't any matches.
110     Don't be ridiculous!
111     The door is extremely rusty and refuses to open.
112     The plant indignantly shakes dry its leaves and asks, "Water?"
113     The hinges are quite thoroughly rusted now and won't budge.
114     The oil has freed up the hinges so that the door will now move,
114     although it requires some effort.
115     The plant has exceptionally deep roots and cannot be pulled free.
116     The dwarves' knives vanish as they strike the walls of the cave.
117     Something you're carrying won't fit through the tunnel with you.
117     You'd best take inventory and drop something.
118     You can't fit this five-foot clam through that little passage!
119     You can't fit this five-foot oyster through that little passage!
120     I advise you to put down the clam before opening it.  >Strain!<
121     I advise you to put down the oyster before opening it.  >Wrench!<
122     You don't have anything strong enough to open the clam.
123     You don't have anything strong enough to open the oyster.
124     A glistening pearl falls out of the clam and rolls away.  Goodness,
124     this must really be an oyster.  (I never was very good at identifying
124     bivalves.)  Whatever it is, it has now snapped shut again.
125     The oyster creaks open, revealing nothing but oyster inside.  It
125     promptly snaps shut again.
126     You have crawled around in some little holes and found your way
126     blocked by a recent cave-in.  You are now back in the main passage.
127     There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.
128     Out from the shadows behind you pounces a bearded pirate!  "Har, har,"
128     he chortles, "I'll just take all this booty and hide it away with me
128     chest deep in the maze!"  He snatches your treasure and vanishes into
128     the gloom.
129     A sepulchral voice reverberating through the cave, says, "Cave closing
129     soon.  All adventurers exit immediately through Main Office."
130     A mysterious recorded voice groans into life and announces:
130        "This exit is closed.  Please leave via Main Office."
131     It looks as though you're dead.  Well, seeing as how it's so close to
131     closing time anyway, I think we'll just call it a day.
132     The sepulchral voice entones, "The cave is now closed."  As the echoes
132     fade, there is a blinding flash of light (and a small puff of orange
132     smoke). . . .    As your eyes refocus, you look around and find...
133     There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
133     wall, burying the dwarves in the rubble.  You march through the hole
133     and find yourself in the Main Office, where a cheering band of
133     friendly elves carry the conquering adventurer off into the sunset.
134     There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
134     wall, burying the snakes in the rubble.  A river of molten lava pours
134     in through the hole, destroying everything in its path, including you!
135     There is a loud explosion, and you are suddenly splashed across the
135     walls of the room.
136     The resulting ruckus has awakened the dwarves.  There are now several
136     threatening little dwarves in the room with you!  Most of them throw
136     knives at you!  All of them get you!
137     Oh, leave the poor unhappy bird alone.
138     I daresay whatever you want is around here somewhere.
139     I'm not sure what you mean by "Stop".  Use "Quit" if you want to give
139     up.
140     You can't get there from here.
141     You are being followed by a very large, tame bear.
142     -          *** THE HISTORY OF ADVENTURE (ABRIDGED) ***          -
142     -                    ** By Ima Wimp **                      -
142     ADVENTURE was originally developed by William Crowther, and later
142     substantially rewritten and expanded by Don Woods at Stanford Univ.
142     According to legend, Crowther's original version was modelled on an
142     a real cavern, called Colossal Cave, which is a part of Kentucky's
142     Mammoth Caverns.  That version of the game included the main maze
142     and a portion of the third-level (Complex Junction - Bedquilt -
142     Swiss Cheese rooms, etc.), but not much more.
142     - - -
142     Don Woods and some others at Stanford later rewrote portions of
142     the original program, and greatly expanded the cave.  That version
142     of the game is recognizable by the maximum score of 350 points.
142     At this writing (November, 1978), that version is by far the most
142     widely known.
142     - - -
142     The latest additions were done throughout 1978 by David Long while
142     at the University of Chicago, Graduate School of Business.
142     Long's additions include the seaside entrance and all of
142     the cave on the "far side" of Lost River (Rainbow Rm - Crystal
142     Palace - Blue Grotto - Rotunda - beyond Joshua's wall, etc., etc.).
142     The current cave is about 50% larger than the Woods/Stanford model.
142     In the process, the code was heavily rewritten to permit more
142     generalized handling of objects and to allow a far more complex
142     syntax.  The current maximum score is 501 points.
142     - - -
142     Except for a couple of trivial subroutines (to get user-ID's for
142     logging purposes), ADVENTURE is written entirely in FORTRAN.  This
142     not because Crowther/Woods/Long love FORTRAN, but because it is
142     almost infinitely portable.  There were indeed moments when it took
142     great strength to withstand the temptation to whip out some character
142     handling routine in MACRO, instead of the furshlugginer compiler.
142     For example, there is an excellent rival game to Adventure, called
142     DUNGEON, developed at M.I.T., which is totally non-portable since
142     it is coded in an obscure variant of two initially obscure compilers,
142     and can only be transported in executable form between DEC-10's
142     and 20's.
142     - - -
142     Those interested in obtaining the latest releases of either the
142     source (FORTRAN IV) or executable code (DEC-20) should contact:
142     David E. Long, GSB Computing Services, University of Chicago,
142     5836 S. Greenwood Ave, Chicago IL 60637,  (312) 753-4290.
142     To determine how out of date your version is, check the release date
142     and number printed in the opening line of each game.  The version
142     number is parsed thusly: Version (say) 5.1/6 is major version 5,

142     release 1, bugfix 6.  The release number is changed only when the
142     cave mapping is altered or when new items are added.  The major
142     version number is incremented after adding extensions large enough
142     to affect the overall flavor of the game.  To whet curious appetites,
142     major version 6 is projected to appear sometime around the summer
142     of 1979.  It will contain a whole new wing to the cave (natch!)
142     plus a much enlarged surface area, including the Great Serbonian
142     Bog, the Castle of Aldor and the terrifying Passage of Fire.
142     Stay tuned!

142     Thanks are owed to Roger Matus and David Feldman, both of U. of C.,
142     for several suggestions, including the Rainbow Room, the telephone
142     booth and the fearsome Wumpus.  Further thanks go to J. R. Carlson
142     for many debugging suggestions.  Most thanks (and apologies)
142     go to Thomas Malory, Charles Dodgson, the Grimm Brothers, Dante,
142     Homer, Frank Baum and especially Anon., the real authors of ADVENTURE.
142     - - - -
143     Do you indeed wish to quit now?
144     There is nothing here with which to fill the vase.
145     The sudden change in temperature has delicately shattered the vase.
146     It is beyond your power to do that.
147     I don't know how.
148     It is too far up for you to reach.
149     You killed a little dwarf.  The body vanishes in a cloud of greasy
149     black smoke.
150     The shell is very strong and is impervious to attack.
151     What's the matter, can't you read?  Now you'd best start over.
152     The axe bounces harmlessly off the dragon's thick scales.
153     The dragon looks rather nasty.  You'd best not try to get by.
154     The little bird attacks the green dragon, and in an astounding flurry
154     gets burnt to a cinder.  The ashes blow away.
155     On what?
156     Okay, from now on I'll only describe a place in full the first time
156     you come to it.  To get the full description, say "LOOK".
157     Trolls are close relatives with the rocks and have skin as tough as
157     that of a rhinoceros.  The troll fends off your blows effortlessly.
158     The troll deftly catches the axe, examines it carefully, and tosses it
158     back, declaring, "Good workmanship, but it's not valuable enough."
159     The troll catches your treasure and scurries away out of sight.
160     The troll refuses to let you cross.
161     There is no longer any way across the chasm.
162     Just as you reach the other side, the bridge buckles beneath the
162     weight of the bear, which was still following you around.  You
162     scrabble desperately for support, but as the bridge collapses you
162     stumble back and fall into the chasm.
163     The bear lumbers toward the troll, who lets out a startled shriek and
163     scurries away.  The bear soon gives up the pursuit and wanders back.
164     The axe misses and lands near the bear where you can't get at it.
165     With what?  Your bare hands?  Against *HIS* bear hands??
166     The bear is confused; he only wants to be your friend.
167     For crying out loud, the poor thing is already dead!
168     The bear eagerly licks up the honeycomb, after which he seems to calm
168     down considerably and even becomes rather friendly.
169     The bear is still chained to the wall.
170     The chain is still locked.
171     The chain is now unlocked.
172     The chain is now locked.
173     There is nothing here to which the chain can be locked.
174     There is nothing here to eat.
175     Do you want the hint?
176     Do you need help getting out of the maze?
177     You can make the passages look less alike by dropping things.
178     Are you trying to explore beyond the Plover Room?
179     There is a way to explore that region without having to worry about
179     falling into a pit.  None of the objects available is immediately
179     useful in discovering the secret.
180     Do you need help getting out of here?
181     Don't go west.
182     Gluttony is not one of the troll's vices.  Avarice, however, is.
183     Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best start wrapping this up, unless
183     you can find some fresh batteries.  I seem to recall there's a vending
183     machine in the maze.  Bring some coins with you.
184     Your lamp has run out of power.
185     There's not much point in wandering around out here, and you can't
185     explore the cave without a lamp.  So let's just call it a day.
186     There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.  As you
186     turn toward them, the beam of your lamp falls across a bearded pirate.
186     He is carrying a large chest.  "Shiver me timbers!", he cries, "I've
186     been spotted!  I'd best hie meself off to the maze to hide me chest!"
186     With that, he vanishes into the gloom.
187     Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best replace those batteries.
188     Your lamp is now shining with renewed strength.
189     Your lamp is getting dim, and you haven't any more coins.  You'd
189     best start wrapping this up.
190     I'm afraid the magazine is written in dwarvish.
191     "This is not the maze where the pirate leaves his treasure chest."
192     Hmmm, this looks like a clue, which means it'll cost you 10 points to
192     read it.  Should I go ahead and read it anyway?
193     It says, "There is something strange about this place, such that one
193     of the words I've always known now has a new effect."
194     It says the same thing it did before.
195     I'm afraid I don't understand.
196     "Congratulations on bringing light into the dark-room!"
197     You strike the mirror a resounding blow, whereupon it shatters into a
197     myriad tiny fragments.
198     You have taken the vase and hurled it delicately to the ground.
199     You prod the nearest dwarf, who wakes up grumpily, takes one look at
199     you, curses, and grabs for his axe.
200     Is this acceptable?
201     There's no point in suspending a demonstration game.
202     You managed to climb about halfway up before losing your hold and
202     sliding back.
203     You were only a few yards from the top when you slipped and tumbled
203     all the way back down.
204     Ok, ok.  No need to be grabby.
205     Pulling an angry bear around is a good way to get your arm ripped off.
206     The sword is now very clean.
207     The sword is now covered with oil.
208     The handle is now too slippery to grasp.
209     You have no scabbord!
210     You are already wearing it!
211     Do you want to extract the sword from the anvil?
212     If you could convince me of your royal blood, you might get somewhere.
213     Are you trying to go up the slide?
214     Maybe you'd better look for another way into the cave.
215     You grasp the sword's handle and pull, but the sword won't budge.
215     Do you want to try yanking it out?
216     A tiny elf runs straight at you, shouts "Phuce!", and
216     disappears into the forest.
217     You can't swim.  You'd best go by boat.
218     The boat's oars were stolen by the dwarves to play bing-bong.
218     (That's dwarvish ping-pong -- with rocks!).  You have no way
218     to propel the boat.
219     You are still in the boat.  It is too heavy to carry.
220     You had better leave the boat first.
221     You are now sitting in a small boat.
222     You couldn't possibly cross this sea without a large ship.
223     The cliff is unscalable.
224     Your keys are all too large for the lock.
225     The wall is too smooth to climb.
226     The shelf is beyond your reach.
227     You are already wearing them!
228     You thought maybe these were peyote??  You feel a little dizzy,
228     but nothing happens.
229     You are growing taller, expanding like a telescope!  Just before
229     your head strikes the top of the chamber, the mysterious process
229     stops as suddenly as it began.
230     You are closing up like an accordian....shrinking..shrinking.  You
230     are now your normal size.
231     You have smashed your bottle all over the ground.
232     You are now too big to leave the way you came in.
233     This is obviously an elfin entrance.  Unless you can squeeze
233     yourself through a six-inch door, you'll have to find another
233     way into the cave.
234     The wrought-iron door is now locked.
235     The tiny door is now locked.
236     The wrought-iron door is now unlocked.
237     The tiny door is now unlocked.
238     You are blocked by a wall of solid rock.
239     >$<
240     The Wumpus looks at the food with distaste.  He looks at *YOU* with
240     relish!
241     You have jerked the cloak free of the rocks.  However, in doing
241     so you have caused a small rockslide, blocking the entrance
241     and making an unholy din.
242     The cloak is stuck tight under the rocks.  You'll probably have to
242     yank it out.
243     The Wumpus grabs the axe, stops and picks his teeth with it for a few
243     moments while looking thoughtfully at you.  When he finishes picking
243     his teeth, he eats the axe, belches, farts... and starts after
243     you again!
244     As the bridge disappears, the Wumpus scrambles frantically to reach
244     your side of the fissure.  He misses by inches, and with a horrible
244     shriek plunges to his death in the depths of the fissure!
245     You can't even hit a sleeping Wumpus!  The axe is now lying too near
245     the Wumpus for you to retrieve it.
246     The Wumpus is between you and the axe.  You can't reach it.
247     You can't fit through a six-inch door!
248     The dog easily dodges the axe, which lands beyond him where you can't
248     get at it.
249     The dog wolfs (natch) down the food and looks around hungrily for
249     more.  However, he does not appear to be any better disposed towards
249     your presence.
250     You've got to be kidding!
251     It's attached to the wall!
252     You can't put a thing into itself!
253     The gnome firmly blocks the door of the booth.  You can't enter.
254     The constant ringing has awakened the dwarves!
254     There are now several threatening little dwarves in the room with
254     you!  Most of them throw knives at you!  All of them get you!
255     The telephone is out of order.
256     The telephone is out of order and your hand is sore.
257     A couple of lead slugs drop from the coinbox.  (Gnomes are
257     notoriously cheap....)  But you've broken the phone beyond
257     all hope.
258     He wants treasure, not gab.
259     He didn't say anything!
260     It isn't a parrot.  He didn't say anything.
261     No one replies.  The line goes dead with a faint "Click".
262     I think you are a little confused!
263     As you move towards the phone booth, a gnome suddenly streaks
263     around the corner, jumps into the booth and rudely slams the door
263     in your face.  You can't get in.
264     He isn't hungry.
265     As the blast of the horn reverberates through the chamber, the
265     seemingly solid rock wall crumbles away, revealing another room just
265     beyond.  The wall was most likely worn thin by an ancient watercourse
265     which dried up just before completely wearing away the rock.
266     The chamber reverberates to the blast of the horn.
266     (Satchmo you ain't!)
267     The bees swarm over the fresh flowers, leaving the hive unguarded
267     and revealing a sweet honeycomb.
268     You are now out of breath.
269     It isn't ringing!
270     A hairy paw reaches out of the darkness and....
271     You don't have the correct change.
272     You go a short way down the bright passage, but the light
272     grows to blinding intensity.  You can't continue.
273     You know, if you type "BRIEF", I won't have to keep repeating these
273     long descriptions of each room.
274     Are you trying to reach the natural bridge?
275     You can't get to it by climbing the walls or jumping or anything
275     like that.  You could always put in a telephone call to the local
275     spelunking club for advice, if you could find a phone.
276     You turkey!!!  Now you've done it!  It took some effort, but you
276     woke up the Wumpus.  He slowly opens one red eye, and then another,
276     and then one more (!!), and looks at you sleepily.  He had been
276     dreaming of a late snack.  If you don't act quickly, you'll
276     be a *late* adventurer!
277     The blast of your horn echos throughout hill and dale.
278     All you have are watercress sandwiches.  The bear is less than
278     interested.
279     You have smashed your sword to smithereens against a rock.
280     Setting yourself adrift in the boat with no way to propel it would
280     not be very smart.  Best to keep the pole.
281     You're already in it!
282     You've hit the jackpot!!  Hundreds of coins and slugs cascade from
282     the telephone's coin return slot and spill all over the floor of
282     the booth.
283     Whoops!  The floor has opened out from under you!  It seems you
283     have fallen into a bottomless pit.  As a matter of fact, you're
283     still falling!  Well, I have better things to do than wait around
283     for you to strike bottom, so let's just assume you're dead.
283     Sorry about that, Chief.
284     The telephone in the booth has begun to ring.
285     I don't understand what you are trying to do!
286     How do you propose to cross the river?
287     The air is filled with beautiful music.
288     The air fills with beautiful music.  The dog gradually becomes
288     less fierce, and after a short while he lies down by the side of
288     the cavern and falls into a deep sleep.
289     Are you trying to get past the dog?
290     The only person I can remember who managed to get past the dog
290     was that singer, ummm, what's his name... Euridice's friend....
291     That wouldn't be wise.  It is best to let sleeping dogs lie.
292     The stream flows out of one very small crack and into another.
292     You can't go that way.
293     The river is too wide and deep to cross.
294     The glare is absolutely blinding.  If you proceed you are likely
294     to fall into a pit.
295     The hum of the bees rises to an angry buzz as you move towards
295     the hive.
296     The sticks and branches are all in a tangle and are stuck in the
296     mud.  You'd need a shovel to dig them out.
297     You're already carrying them!
298     The chalice is slightly cracked.  It won't hold any liquids.
299     The cask is now empty.
300     The wine goes right to your head.  You reel around in a drunken
300     stupor and finally pass out.  You awaken with a splitting headache,
300     and try to focus your eyes....
301     Yeeeecchhh!!
302     Your bottle is already full.
303     The cask is already full.
304     There is nothing here with which to fill the bottle.
305     There is nothing here which you would want to put into the cask.
306     Your bottle is now full of water.
307     The cask is now full of water.
308     Your bottle is now full of oil.
309     The cask is now full of oil.
310     The bottle is now full of wine.
311     The cask is now full of wine.
312     You have nothing in which to carry it.
313     You can't fill that.
314     Do you want it in the bottle or the cask?
315     Your containers are both full.
316     It's empty.
317     Hmmm, I see you have already gone through an extra set of batteries.
317     I'll get rid of the trash for you.
318     The bridge shakes as you cross.  Large hunks of clay and rock near
318     the edge break off and hurtle far down into the chasm.  Several of
318     the cracks on the bridge surface widen perceptibly.
319     The load is too much for the bridge!  With a roar, the entire
319     structure gives way, plunging you headlong into the raging river at
319     the bottom of the chasm and scattering all your holdings.  As the
319     icy waters close over your head, you flail and thrash with all your
319     might, and with your last ounce of strength pull yourself onto the
319     south bank of the river.
320     You can't get at him.  He is inside the phone booth.
321     Your lamp is already on.
322     Your lamp is already off.
323     Your lamp is again growing dim.  You'd better get some more batteries.
324     You know, you are wasting your batteries by wandering around out
324     here with your light on.
325     <Adventure-- Version:5.2/2, October-79>
326     Dead wumpi, as a rule, are light eaters.  Nothing happens.
327     How do expect to feed a sleeping Wumpus?
328     You aren't holding it!
329     It won't fit!
330     The coin drops into the slot with a dull "clunk".  There is no
330     dial tone.
331     It's already there.
332     Thank you for your comments.  They will be dispatched immediately
332     via Gnome Express to the Wizard.
333     The chest is now unlocked.
334     The chest is now locked.
335     You can't get at it.
336     It's already open.
337     It's locked.
338     It's already closed.
339     You can't fill that.  It would leak all over the place.
340     It's not inside anything.
341     It isn't there!
342     How?
343     Taken.
344     Dropped.
345     I don't think I can.
346     Interesting.  How?
347     Huh?
348     You are in perfect health.
349     You are fit as a fiddle.
350     Only wizards can do that!
351     Are you kidding?  Do you want to suffocate the poor thing?
352     Thrown.
353     Left.
354     You can't get close enough for a clean thrust.
355     As you move in for the kill, the dwarf neatly slips a knife
355     between your ribs.
356     As you approach, the dwarf slashes out with his knife!
357     It's too dark to see anything!
358     It's not open.
359     There's nothing inside.
360     It contains:
361     The billboard reads:
361     "Visit Beautiful Colossal Cave.  Open Year Around.  Fun for
361     the entire family, or at least for those who survive."
361     Below the headline is an impossibly complicated map showing how
361     to find Colossal Cave.  Not that it matters, because all the
361     directions are written in Elvish.
362     Hidden behind the poster is a steel safe, embedded in the wall.
363     Brushing the dust from one of the larger rocks reveals some carved
363     characters.
364     Enough dusting, already!  You're making me sneeze.
365     The safe door smoothly swings open.
366     Maybe if you rubbed your fingertips with sandpaper....
367     The safe's door clicks shut.
368     This is a combination safe.  The keys won't help.
369     I certainly can't read in this light.
370     The poster has on it a picture of a short, fat wizard with a bushy
370     red beard and a white painted face.  He is playing an electric
370     guitar.  The caption reads:  'LOOK OUT KISS!!  Here comes WIZZ!!!!
370     Brian Baas lead singer and vocals.  Playing at a Woodstock
370     near you!'
371     "Click."
372     In the rock is carved the message "7-22-34".
373     You can't get at them.
374     Ok, I'll give you the full description whenever you enter a room
374     for the first time.
375     You don't have the right key.
376     That's not strong enough to open the clam.
377     That's not strong enough to open the oyster.
378     As you approach, the spider's grin widens.  I wouldn't proceed
378     any further.
379     The spider grabs the fly, wraps it silk, and proceeds to quietly
379     munch on it, leaving the door unguarded.

381     You are a bit off top form, but nothing to worry about.
382     You are weaker than usual.  Better avoid fights.
383     You really ought to take a break.  You're in tough shape.
384     You are on the edge of collapse.  Lots of sun and fresh air will
384     speed your recovery.
385     Your strength is nearly gone.  Only a miracle can save you now.
386     It reads (in intricate design): 'Shamut'

391     Is it hot in here?  You are flushed and sweating.
392     You are feeling definitely peculiar, weak....
393     You're dizzy, nauseous.  You can barely stand.
394     You are really ill.  If you don't find an antidote soon, it's
394     curtains.
395     You are a walking wound.  You are very weak.  You'd better find out
395     what's wrong before it's too late.
396     Sheeesh!  What a mess!  Your hair has fallen out and your skin is
396     covered with blisters.  And not an asprin in sight!
397     Well, you tried, but your strength is gone.  The agony is finally
397     over.
398     The fly buzzes his last buzz and takes a nosedive.
399     Suddenly, one of the stone contortions comes to life!  It is
399     an old, lethargic ogre, who ambles toward you and hands you an
399     old scrap of parchment.  He then disappears before your very eyes!

1       A large cloud of green smoke appears in front of you.  It clears away
1       to reveal a tall wizard, clothed in grey.  He fixes you with a steely
1       glare and declares, "This adventure has lasted too long."  With that
1       he makes a single pass over you with his hands, and everything around
1       you fades away into a grey nothingness.
2       Even wizards have to wait longer than that!
3       I'm terribly sorry, but Colossal Cave is closed.  Our hours are:
4       Only wizards are permitted within the cave right now.
5       We do allow visitors to make short explorations during our off hours.
5       Would you like to do that?
6       Colossal Cave is open to regular adventurers at the following hours:
7       Very well.
8       Only a wizard may continue an adventure this soon.
9       I suggest you resume your adventure at a later time.
10      Do you wish to see the hours?
11      Do you wish to change the hours?
12      New magic word (null to leave unchanged):
13      New magic number (null to leave unchanged):
14      Do you wish to change the message of the day?
15      Okay.  You can save this version now.
16      Are you a wizard?
17      Prove it!  Say the magic word!
18      That is not what I thought it was.  Do you know what I thought it was?
19      Oh dear, you really *ARE* a wizard!  Sorry to have bothered you . . .
20      Foo, you are nothing but a charlatan!
21      New hours specified by defining "Prime Time".  Give only the hour
21      (e.g. 14, Not 14:00 or 2pm).  Enter a negative number after last pair.
22      New hours for Colossal Cave:
23      Limit each line to 70 chars.  End with a blank line.
24      Line too long, retype:
25      Not enough room for another line.  Ending message here.
26      Do you wish to (re)schedule the next holiday?
27      To begin how many days from today?
28      To last how many days (zero if no holiday)?
29      To be called what (up to 20 characters)?
30      Too small!  Assuming minimum value (45 minutes).
31      Break out of this and save your core-image.
32      Be sure to save your core-image...
33      Do you need a new map?
34      There is water here.
35      There is oil here.
36      There is wine (hic) here.
