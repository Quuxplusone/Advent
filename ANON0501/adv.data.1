1       You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.
1       Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows out of the building and
1       down a gully.
2       You have walked up a hill, still in the forest.  The road slopes back
2       down the other side of the hill.  There is a building in the distance.
3       You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring.  Off
3       to one side is a small pantry.
4       You are in a valley in the forest beside a stream tumbling along a
4       rocky bed.
5       You are in open forest, with a deep valley to one side.  Not far
5       is a large billboard.
6       You are in open forest near both a valley and a road.
7       At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a 2-inch slit
7       in the rock.  Downstream the streambed is bare rock.
8       You are in a 20-foot depression floored with bare dirt.  Set into the
8       dirt is a strong steel grate mounted in concrete.  A dry streambed
8       leads into the depression.
9       You are in a small chamber beneath a 3x3 steel grate to the surface.
9       A low crawl over cobbles leads inward to the west.
10      You are crawling over cobbles in a low passage.  There is a dim light
10      at the east end of the passage.
11      You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the surface.
11      A low wide passage with cobbles becomes plugged with mud and debris
11      here, but an awkward canyon leads upward and west.  A note on the wall
11      says "Magic Word XYZZY".
12      You are in an awkward sloping east/west canyon.  There is a small
12      hole in the north wall.
13      You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet high.  The walls are frozen
13      rivers of orange stone.  An awkward canyon and a good passage exit
13      from east and west sides of the chamber.
14      At your feet is a small pit breathing traces of white mist.  An east
14      passage ends here except for a small crack leading on.
15      You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of sight to
15      the west.  There are openings to either side.  Nearby, a wide stone
15      staircase leads downward.  The hall is filled with wisps of white mist
15      swaying to and fro almost as if alive.  A cold wind blows up the
15      staircase.  There is a passage at the top of a dome behind you.
16      The crack is far too small for you to follow.
17      You are on the east bank of a fissure slicing clear across the hall.
17      The mist is quite thick here, and the fissure is too wide to jump.
18      This is a low room with a crude note on the wall.  The note says,
18      "You won't get it up the steps".
19      You are in the Hall of the Mountain King, with passages off in all
19      directions.
20      You are at the bottom of the pit with a broken neck.
21      You didn't make it.
22      The dome is unclimbable.
23      You are at the west end of the Twopit Room.  There is a large hole in
23      the wall above the pit at this end of the room.
24      You are at the bottom of the eastern pit in the Twopit Room.  There is
24      a small pool of oil in one corner of the pit.
25      You are at the bottom of the western pit in the Twopit Room.  There is
25      a large hole in the wall about 25 feet above you.
26      You clamber up the plant and scurry through the hole at the top.
27      You are on the west side of the fissure in the Hall of Mists.
28      You are in a low N/S passage at a hole in the floor.  The hole goes
28      down to an E/W passage.
29      You are in the South Side Chamber.
30      You are in the West Side Chamber of the Hall of the Mountain King.
30      A passage continues west and up here.
31      >$<
32      You can't get by the snake.
33      You are in a large room, with a passage to the south, a passage to the
33      west, and a wall of broken rock to the east.  There is a large "Y2" on
33      a rock in the room's center.
34      You are in a jumble of rock, with cracks everywhere.
35      You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of
35      sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below.  Traces of
35      white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the right.
35      Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that
35      someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and
35      25 feet away there is a similar window looking into a lighted room.  A
35      shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.
36      You are in a dirty broken passage.  To the east is a crawl.  To the
36      west is a large passage.  Above you is a hole to another passage.
37      You are on the brink of a small clean climbable pit.  A crawl leads
37      west.
38      You are in the bottom of a small pit with a little stream, which
38      enters and exits through tiny slits.
39      You are in a large room full of dusty rocks.  There is a big hole in
39      the floor.  There are cracks everywhere, and a passage leading east.
40      You have crawled through a very low wide passage parallel to and north
40      of the Hall of Mists.
41      You are at the west end of Hall of Mists.  A low wide crawl continues
41      west and another goes north.  To the south is a little passage 6 feet
41      off the floor.
42      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
43      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.

55      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
56      Dead end.
57      You are on the brink of a thirty foot pit with a massive orange column
57      down one wall.  You could climb down here but you could not get back
57      up.  The maze continues at this level.
58      Dead end.
59      You have crawled through a very low wide passage parallel to and north
59      of the Hall of Mists.
60      You are at the east end of a very long hall apparently without side
60      chambers.  In the south wall are several wide cracks and a high
60      hole, but the hole is far above your head.  To the east a wide
60      crawl slants up.  To the north a round two foot hole slants down.
61      You are at the west end of a very long featureless hall.  The hall
61      joins up with a narrow north/south passage.
62      You are at a crossover of a high N/S passage and a low E/W one.
63      Dead end.
64      You are at a complex junction.  A low hands and knees passage from the
64      north joins a higher crawl from the east to make a walking passage
64      going west.  There is also a large room above.  The air is damp here.
65      You are in Bedquilt, a long east/west passage with holes everywhere.
65      To explore at random select north, south, up, or down.
66      You are in a room whose walls resemble swiss cheese.  Obvious passages
66      go west, east, NE, and NW.  Part of the room is occupied by a large
66      bedrock block.
67      You are at the east end of the Twopit Room.  The floor here is
67      littered with thin rock slabs, which make it easy to descend the pits.
67      There is a path here bypassing the pits to connect passages from east
67      and west.  There are holes all over, but the only big one is on the
67      wall directly over the west pit where you can't get to it.
68      You are in a large low circular chamber whose floor is an immense slab
68      fallen from the ceiling (Slab Room).  East and west there once were
68      large passages, but they are now filled with boulders.  Low small
68      passages go north and south, and the south one quickly bends west
68      around the boulders.
69      You are in a secret N/S canyon above a large room.
70      You are in a secret N/S canyon above a sizable passage.
71      You are in a secret canyon at a junction of three canyons, bearing
71      north, south, and SE.  The north one is as tall as the other two
71      combined.
72      You are in a large low room.  Crawls lead north, NE, and SW.
73      Dead end crawl.
74      You are in a secret canyon which here runs E/W.  It crosses over a
74      very tight canyon 15 feet below.  If you go down you may not be able
74      to get back up.
75      You are at a wide place in a very tight N/S canyon.
76      The canyon here becomes too tight to go further south.
77      You are in a tall E/W canyon.  A low tight crawl goes 3 feet north and
77      seems to open up.
78      The canyon runs into a mass of boulders -- dead end.
79      The stream flows out through a pair of 1 foot diameter sewer pipes.
79      It would be advisable to use the exit.
80      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
81      Dead end.
82      Dead end.

85      Dead end.
86      Dead end.
87      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
88      You are in a long, narrow corridor stretching out of sight to the
88      west.  At the eastern end is a hole through which you can see a
88      profusion of leaves.
89      There is nothing here to climb.  Use "up" or "out" to leave the pit.
90      You have climbed up the plant and out of the pit.
91      You are at the top of a steep incline above a large room.  You could
91      climb down here, but you would not be able to climb up.  There is a
91      passage leading back to the north.
92      You are in the Giant Room.  The ceiling here is too high up for your
92      lamp to show it.  Cavernous passages lead east, north, and south.  On
92      the west wall is scrawled the inscription, "FEE FIE FOE FOO" [sic].
93      The passage here is blocked by a recent cave-in.
94      You are at one end of an immense north/south passage.
95      You are in a magnificent cavern with a rushing stream, which cascades
95      over a sparkling waterfall into a roaring whirlpool which disappears
95      through a hole in the floor.  Passages exit to the south and west.
96      You are in the Soft Room.  The walls are covered with heavy curtains,
96      the floor with a thick pile carpet.  Moss covers the ceiling.
97      This is the Oriental Room.  Ancient oriental cave drawings cover the
97      walls.  A gently sloping passage leads upward to the north, another
97      passage leads SE, and a hands and knees crawl leads east.
98      You are following a wide path around the outer edge of a large cavern.
98      Far below, through a heavy white mist, strange splashing noises can be
98      heard.  The mist rises up through a fissure in the ceiling.  The path
98      hugs the cavern's rim to the NE and south, while another branch forks
98      west.  A round chute with extremely smooth walls angles sharply up
98      to the southwest.
99      You are in an alcove.  A small NW path seems to widen after a short
99      distance.  An extremely tight tunnel leads east.  It looks like a very
99      tight squeeze.  An eerie light can be seen at the other end.
100     You're in a small chamber lit by an eerie green light.  An extremely
100     narrow tunnel exits to the west, and a dark corridor leads NE.
101     You're in the Dark-Room.  A corridor leading south is the only exit.
102     You are in an arched hall.  A coral passage once continued up and east
102     from here, but is now blocked by debris.  The air smells of sea water.
103     You're in a large room carved out of sedimentary rock.  The floor and
103     walls are littered with bits of shells imbedded in the stone.  A
103     shallow passage proceeds downward, and a somewhat steeper one leads
103     up.  A low hands and knees passage enters from the south.
104     You are in a long sloping corridor with ragged sharp walls.
105     You are in a cul-de-sac about eight feet across.
106     You are in an anteroom leading to a large passage to the east.  Small
106     passages go west and up.  The remnants of recent digging are evident.
106     A sign in midair here says "Cave under construction beyond this point.
106     Proceed at own risk.  [Witt Construction Company]".
107     You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all different.
108     You are at Witt's End.  Passages lead off in *ALL* directions.
109     You are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across.  The floor is
109     covered by white mist seeping in from the north.  The walls extend
109     upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspended from some unseen point far
109     above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and
109     midway between the canyon walls.  (The mirror is obviously provided
109     for the use of the dwarves, who as you know, are extremely vain.)  A
109     small window can be seen in either wall, some fifty feet up.
110     You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of
110     sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below.  Traces of
110     white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the left.
110     Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that
110     someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and
110     25 feet away there is a similar window looking into a lighted room.  A
110     shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.
111     A large stalactite extends from the roof and almost reaches the floor
111     below.  You could climb down it, and jump from it to the floor, but
111     having done so you would be unable to reach it to climb back up.
112     You are in a little maze of twisting passages, all different.
113     You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir.  An opaque cloud
113     of white mist fills the room and rises rapidly upward.  The lake is
113     fed by a stream, which tumbles out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet
113     overhead and splashes noisily into the water somewhere within the
113     mist.  The indistinct shape of the opposite shore can be dimly seen
113     through the mist.  The only passage goes back toward the south.
114     Dead end.
115     You are at the northeast end of an immense room, even larger than the
115     Giant Room.  It appears to be a repository for the "ADVENTURE"
115     program.  Massive torches far overhead bathe the room with smokey
115     yellow light.  Scattered about you can be seen a pile of bottles (all
115     of them empty), a nursery of young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed
115     of oysters, a bundle of black rods with rusty stars on their ends, and
115     a collection of brass lanterns.  Off to one side a great many dwarves
115     are sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly.  A sign nearby reads: "Do
115     not disturb the dwarves!"  An immense mirror is hanging against one
115     wall, and stretches to the other end of the room, where various other
115     sundry objects can be glimpsed dimly in the distance.  An unoccupied
115     telephone booth stands against the north wall.
116     You are at the southwest end of the repository.  To one side is a pit
116     full of fierce green snakes.  On the other side is a row of small
116     wicker cages, each of which contains a little sulking bird.  In one
116     corner is a bundle of black rods with rusty marks on their ends.  A
116     large number of velvet pillows are scattered about on the floor.  A
116     Beside one of the pillows is a large, dusty, leather-bound volume
116     with the title "History of Adventure" embossed in pure gold.
116     vast mirror stretches off to the northeast, almost reaching the
116     phone booth.  At your feet is a large steel grate, next to which is
116     a sign which reads, "Treasure Vault. Keys in Main Office."
117     You are on one side of a large, deep chasm.  A heavy white mist rising
117     up from below obscures all view of the far side.  A SW path leads away
117     from the chasm into a winding corridor.
118     You are in a long winding corridor sloping out of sight in both
118     directions.
119     You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
120     You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
121     You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
122     You are on the northeast side of a deep chasm.  A NE path leads away
122     from the chasm on this side.
123     You're in a long east/west corridor.  A faint rumbling noise can be
123     heard in the distance.
124     The path forks here.  The left fork leads northeast.  A dull rumbling
124     seems to get louder in that direction.  The right fork leads southeast
124     down a gentle slope.  The main corridor enters from the west.
125     The walls are quite warm here.  From the north can be heard a steady
125     roar, so loud that the entire cave seems to be trembling.  Another
125     passage leads south, and a low crawl goes east.
126     You are on the edge of a breath-taking view.  Far below you is an
126     active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging
126     out, cascading back down into the depths.  The glowing rock fills the
126     farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving every-
126     thing an eerie, macabre appearance.  The air is filled with flickering
126     sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to
126     the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other
126     sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted
126     formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky
126     light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep
126     gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to
126     have been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire
126     crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the
126     gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.  To
126     the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously
126     from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles
126     ominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its
126     own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the already
126     hellish scene.  A dark, foreboding passage exits to the south.
127     You are in a small chamber filled with large boulders.  The walls are
127     very warm, causing the air in the room to be almost stifling from the
127     heat.  The only exit is a crawl heading west, through which is coming
127     a low rumbling.
128     You are walking along a gently sloping north/south passage lined with
128     oddly shaped limestone formations.
129     You are standing at the entrance to a large, barren room.  A sign
129     posted above the entrance reads:  "Caution!  Bear in room!"
130     You are inside a barren room.  The center of the room is completely
130     empty except for some dust.  Marks in the dust lead away toward the
130     far end of the room.  The only exit is the way you came in.
131     You are in a maze of twisting little passages, all different.
132     You are in a little maze of twisty passages, all different.
133     You are in a twisting maze of little passages, all different.
134     You are in a twisting little maze of passages, all different.
135     You are in a twisty little maze of passages, all different.
136     You are in a twisty maze of little passages, all different.
137     You are in a little twisty maze of passages, all different.
138     You are in a maze of little twisting passages, all different.
139     You are in a maze of little twisty passages, all different.
140     Dead end.
141     You are on a narrow promontory at the foot of a waterfall, which
141     spurts from an overhead hole in the rock wall and splashes into a
141     large reservoir, sending up clouds of mist and spray.
141     Through the thick white mist looms a polished marble slab, to
141     which is affixed an enormous rusty iron anvil.  In golden letters
141     are written the words: "Whoso Pulleth Out This Sword of This
141     Stone and Anvil, is Rightwise King-Born of All This Mountain."
141     There is a narrow chimney on the east side of the promontory.
142     You are on a narrow shelf above and east of the top of a very steep
142     chimney.  A long smooth granite slide curves down out of sight
142     to the east.  If you go down the slide, you may not be able to
142     climb back up.
143     You are in the private chamber of the Mountain King.  Hewn into the
143     solid rock of the east wall of the chamber is an intricately-wrought
143     throne of elvish design.  There is an exit to the west.
144     You are on the east side of the throne room.  On the arm of the throne
144     has been hung a sign which reads "Gone for the day: visiting
144     sick snake. --M.K."
145     You are dragged down, down, into the depths of the whirlpool.
145     Just as you can no longer hold your breath, you are shot out over
145     a waterfall into the shallow end of a large reservoir.  Gasping
145     and sputtering, you crawl weakly towards the shore....
146     You are in dense forest, with a hill to one side.  The trees appear
146     to thin out towards the north and east.
147     You are at the high point of a wide grassy knoll, partially surrounded
147     by dense forest.  The land rises to the south and east, and drops off
147     sharply to the north and west.  The air smells of sea water.
148     You are at the edge of a trackless salt marsh.  Tall reeds obscure
148     the view.
149     You're in salt marsh.
150     You're in salty marsh.
151     You are in salt marsh.
152     Dead end.
153     You're on a sandy beach at the edge of the open sea.  The beach
153     streches out of sight to the south.  To the north, the beach ends
153     in cliffs and broken rocks.
154     You are at a jumble of large broken rocks.  A gentle path leads up
154     to the top of the nearby cliffs.  A narrow treacherous path
154     disappears among the rocks at the foot of the cliff.
155     You are on a high cliff overlooking the sea.  Far below the
155     rolling breakers smash into a jumble of large broken rocks.
155     The thunder of the surf is deafening.
156     You're at the bottom of the cliff, smashed to smithereens by the
156     pounding surf.
157     You are at Thunder Hole, a funnel shaped cavern opening onto the sea.
157     The noise of the surf pounding against the outer rocks of the cave is
157     amplified by the peculiar shape of the cave, causing a thunder-like
157     booming sound to reverberate throughout the cave.  Outside, a narrow
157     path leads south towards some large rocks.
158     You are at the top of some arched steps.  On one side is a blank wall
158     with a tiny door at the base and a shelf overhead.  On the other side
158     a westward passage leads to the sea.
159     You are in a low cramped chamber at the back of a small cave.
159     There is a shelf in the rock wall at about the height of your
159     shoulder.
160     You are on a wide ledge, bounded on one side by a rock wall,
160     and on the other by a sheer cliff.  The only way past is through
160     a large wrought-iron door.
161     You feel dizzy...Everything around you is spinning, expanding,
161     growing larger....  Dear me!  Is the cave bigger or are you smaller?
162     You are again overcome by a sickening vertigo, but this time
162     everything around you is shrinking...Shrinking...
163     You are again overcome by a sickening vertigo, but this time
163     everything is shrinking... I mean, you are growing.  This is
163     terribly confusing!
164     You feel dizzy...Everything around you is spinning, expanding,
164     growing larger....
165     You're at the bottom of the cliff with a broken neck.
166     You are at the western tip of the Blue Grotto.  A large lake almost
166     covers the cavern floor, except for where you are standing.  Small
166     holes high in the rock wall to the east admit a dim light.  The
166     reflection of the light from the water suffuses the cavern with
166     a hazy bluish glow.
167     You are on the shore of an underground sea.  A high wooden
167     structure of vast proportions extends out into the water to the
167     east.  The way west is through a wrought-iron door.
168     You are on the eastern shore of the Blue Grotto.  An ascending
168     tunnel disappears into the darkness to the SE.
169     You are at a high rock on the NE side of a watery chamber at the mouth
169     of a small brook.  An unknown gas bubbles up through the water from
169     the chamber floor.  A bluish light can be seen to the southwest.
170     You are in a windy tunnel between two large rooms.
171     You are in the Bat Cave.  The walls and ceiling are covered with
171     sleeping bats.  The floor is buried by a mass of dry, foul-smelling
171     guano.  The stench is overpowering.  Exits to the NW and east.
172     You are in a very tight N/S crack.  The passage seems to widen to
172     the south.
173     You are in a very tight N/S crack.  The passage south is blocked
173     by a recent cave-in.
174     You're in the Cloakroom.  This is where the dreaded Wumpus repairs
174     to sleep off heavy meals.  (Adventurers are his favorite dinner!)
174     Two very narrow passages exit NW and NE.
175     You're in a room containing several small climable pits.  Passages
175     exit to the east and north.
176     You are at the bottom of a small featureless pit.
177     You are at a high hole in a rock wall.
178     The NE passage is blocked by a recent cave-in.
179     You are in a sloping muddy defile, next to a tumbling brook.
180     You are in a level E/W passage partially blocked by an overhanging
180     tongue of rock.  A steep scramble would take you up over the tongue,
180     whence continues an upward crawl.
181     The dog won't let you pass.
182     You're in the Upper Passage, a long level E/W tunnel.
183     You are in a star-shaped chamber.  Passages exit north, east, south,
183     and west.
184     You are at an elbow in a winding E/W passage.
185     Dead end.
186     You're at the intersection of two long tunnels.  One goes NW,
186     the other NE.
187     You're in a long narrow east-west passage which curves out of sight
187     at both ends.
188     You're in the Rotunda.  Corridors radiate in all directions.
188     There is a telephone booth standing against the north wall.
189     You are standing in a telephone booth at the side of a large chamber.
189     Hung on the wall is a banged-up pay telephone of ancient design.
190     You're at the Devil's Chair, a large crystallization shaped like a
190     seat, at the edge of a black abyss.  You can't see the bottom.
190     An upward path leads away from the abyss.
191     You're in a dead-end crack.
192     You're on a small gravel beach at the south wall of the Blue Grotto.
192     A gravelly path leads east.
193     You are in the Flower Room.  The walls are covered with colorful,
193     intricate, flower-like patterns of crystallized gypsum.
194     You are at the end of a short E/W corridor.
195     You are looking west from the end of a short E/W corridor.  At your
195     feet is a pile of loose rubble.  On your left is a hole into another
195     chamber.
196     You are in an arched hall.  The remnants of a now-plugged coral
196     passage lie to the east.  The north wall has partially crumbled,
196     exposing a large connecting hole to another room.
197     You're in the Vestibule, a short passageway between two rooms.
198     You are in the Fairy Grotto.  All around you innumerable stalactites,
198     arranged in immense colonnades, form elegant arches.  On every side
198     you hear the dripping of water, like the footsteps of a thousand
198     fairies.  A small stream runs from the SW corner.  A bright glow
198     emanates from the south side of the grotto, and a steep passage
198     descends to the east.
199     You have approached the lower end of a steep passage, but it is
199     just too cold here to hang around, and you aren't properly equipped
199     to continue.  With teeth chattering, you climb back up....
200     You are in the Crystal Palace.  An overhead vein of phosphorescent
200     quartz casts a liminous glow which is reflected by countless chips of
200     mica embedded in both walls, which consist of some sort of highly
200     reflective glass, apparently of volcanic origin.  A winding path
200     of yellow sandstone leads west and rises steeply to the east.
201     You are following a yellow sandstone path.  There is a glow
201     to the west.
202     You are in a very tall chamber whose walls are comprised of many
202     different rock strata.  Layers of red and yellow sandstone
202     intertwine with bright bands of calcareous limestone in a rainbow-
202     like profusion of color.  The rainbow effect is so real, you
202     are almost tempted to look for a pot of gold!  Poised far over
202     your head, a gigantic slab, wedged tightly between the north and
202     south walls, forms a natural bridge across the roof of the chamber.
203     You're in a steeply sloping passage.  It is very cold here.
204     You are in the Hall of Ice, in the deepest part of the caverns.
204     During winter, frigid outside air settles here, making this room
204     extremely cold all year round.  The walls and ceilings are covered
204     with a thick coating of ice.  An upward passage exits to the west.
205     You are standing on a natural bridge far above the floor of a circular
205     chamber whose walls are a rainbow of multi-colored rock.  The bridge
205     was formed eons ago by a huge slab which fell from the ceiling and
205     is now jammed between the north and south walls of the chamber.
206     You are in a low, wide room below another chamber.  A small green
206     pond fills the center of the room.  The lake is apparently spring-
206     fed.  A small stream exits through a narrow passage to the north.
206     A larger passage continues west.
207     You are in a tight north/south crawl through a stratum of red
207     colored rock.  The air is damp with mist.
208     You are in a tall canyon on the south side of a swift, wide river.
208     Written in the mud in crude letters are the words: "You Have Found
208     Lost River."  A wide path leads west along the bank.  A tight
208     crawlway would take you out of the canyon.
209     You are standing on a large flat rock table at the western end of
209     Lost River Canyon.  Beneath your feet, the river disappears amidst
209     foam and spray into a large sinkhole.  A gentle path leads east
209     along the river's south shore.  Another leads sharply upward along
209     the river's north side.
210     You are at a niche in the canyon wall, far above a raging river.
210     The air is filled with mist and spray, making it difficult to see
210     ahead.  A downward sloping ledge narrows to the east.
211     The ledge is growing very narrow and treacherous, and falls off almost
211     vertically.  You could go down, but you won't be able to climb
211     back.
212     You are standing in a telephone booth at the side of the Repository.
213     You're at the east end of a level passage at a hole in the floor.
214     You're at the north edge of a dark cove.
215     You are in a dry granite basin, worn smooth eons ago by water
215     swirling down from a now-dry spillway.
216     You're in a dry spillway east of and above a smooth rock basin.
217     You are in the Winery, a cool dark room which extends some
217     distance off to the east.
218     You are to the east of the Winery, where the room ends in a thicket
218     of high, sharp, pointed, climable limestone pinnacles.  There is a
218     narrow ledge just above the top of the spires.  If you go up, it
218     might be difficult to get back down.
219     You are in a high-vaulted cavern whose roof rises over fifty
219     meters to culminate in a series of pointed arches directly over
219     your head.  There are also two low arches to either side, forming
219     side portals.  The whole effect is that of a gothic cathedral.
220     You're at the east portal of the Gothic Cathedral.
221     You're at the west portal of the Gothic Cathedral.
222     You are at the foot of the Altar, an immense, broad stalagmite.
223     You're on top of an enormous, broad stalagmite.  There is a hole
223     in the ceiling overhead.
224     You are in a room the size and shape of a small crypt.  A narrow
224     cut exits east.  There is a hole in the floor.
225     You are in an extremely bizzare room.  The entire north wall
225     glow with a luminous red light.  There are gnarled stone formations
225     rising from the floor, which look like contorted staues in the
225     wierd red light.  A bronze plaque on the east wall bears the
225     inscription, 'Shamut'.  There is a dark tunnel to the south and an
225     impossibly steep passage west.
226     You are on the floor of the Rainbow Room.  In fact, you are spread
226     *ALL OVER* the floor of the Rainbow Room.
227     You are in a dimly lit passage behind Thunder Hole.  Etched into
227     the rock wall are the ominous words:
227     *       "You are approaching the River Styx.      *
227     *        Laciate Ogni Speranza Voi Ch'Entrate."   *
228     You are at the River Styx, a narrow little stream cutting directly
228     across the passageway.  The edge of the stream is littered with sticks
228     and other debris washed in by a recent rainfall.  On the far side
228     of the river, the passage continues east.
229     You're on the east side of the river's sticks.
230     You are on a ledge at the northern end of a long N/S crawl.  The
230     ledge is above a large number of sharp vertical limestone spires.
230     An attempt to climb down could be dangerous, if you get my *point*!
231     You are very neatly skewered on the point of a sharp rock.
232     You have poled your boat across the calm water.
233     You have poled your boat across the dark water.
234     You have poled your boat across the Blue Grotto.
235     You're at Dante's Rest, on the north side of a yawning dark chasm.
235     A passage continues west along the chasm's edge.
236     You are at the east end of a riverbank path in Lost River Canyon.
237     The staircase is now unclimable.
238     You're in the caretaker's pantry.
239     You have entered Haunted Chamber.  A cold wind whistles eerily
239     throughout the room.  Strange chords from an unseen organ echo
239     from all over.  A passage leads east and a small hole leads south.
240     You are in a steep tunnel slanting down into the earth.  Faint
240     strains of organ music can be heard from above.  You cannot see
240     bottom.
