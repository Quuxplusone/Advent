THIS FILE CONTAINS COMPLETE SPOILERS FOR LONG0501!!
<Adventure--Experimental Version:5.0/6, NOV-78>

Notes:
- This version is extremely tight on lamp life, so this walkthrough includes
    a side trip to get fresh batteries.
- There are only five dwarves. You can safely discard the axe after killing the fifth,
    but this walkthru doesn't rely on that.
- This walkthru relies heavily on one unintentional bug: The weight check is
    skipped for GET when you and the item you're getting are *both* in the boat.
- If you meet the pirate and he steals something important, then you will have
    to detour from this walkthru and go get the chest. YOU MUST BRING THE KEYS!
    If the pirate stole something, his chest will likely be too heavy to lift,
    so you must OPEN CHEST (with the keys) to get out your stuff. Come back
    later to get the chest itself.

[YOU WIN!]


There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
wall, burying the dwarves in the rubble.  You march through the hole
and find yourself in the Main Office, where a cheering band of
friendly elves carry the conquering adventurer off into the sunset.

You scored 501 out of a possible 501, using  850 turns.

All of Adventuredom gives tribute to you, Adventurer Grandmaster!

To achieve the next higher rating would be a neat trick!

CONGRATULATIONS!!
