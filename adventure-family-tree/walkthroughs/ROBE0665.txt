There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
wall, burying the dwarves in the rubble. You march through the hole
and find yourself in the Main Office, where a cheering band of
friendly elves carry the conquering adventurer off into the sunset.
You scored 655 out of a possible 665 using 749 turns.
All of Adventuredom gives tribute to you, Adventurer Grandmaster!
To achieve the next higher rating would be a neat trick!

CONGRATULATIONS!!
