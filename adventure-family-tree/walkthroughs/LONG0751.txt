THIS FILE CONTAINS COMPLETE SPOILERS FOR LONG0751!!
(Version 6.1/3, January 1982)

Thanks to the PC-SIG Library 8th Edition CD-ROM (April 1990), disk 539,
http://cd.textfil.es/geminiatari/FILES/GAMES/WALKTHRU/COLOSSAL.TXT
for most of this information.

Notes:
- Never leave anything unattended above ground until you've killed the pack rat.
    The pirate steals carried treasures; the rat steals unattended items of any kind.
    Not-yet-seen items are of course safe from the rat. This walkthru guarantees that
    the rat will never steal anything important.
- There are only five dwarves. You can safely discard the axe after killing the fifth,
    but this walkthru doesn't rely on that.
- This walkthru relies heavily on at least two inventory-management behaviors that
    are probably unintentional bugs: The weight check is skipped for the WEAR action,
    and also for GET when you and the item you're getting are *both* in the boat.
- If you meet the pirate and he steals something important, then you will have
    to detour from this walkthru and go get the chest. YOU MUST BRING THE KEYS!
    If the pirate stole something, his chest will likely be too heavy to lift,
    so you must OPEN CHEST (with the keys) to get out your stuff. Come back
    later to get the chest itself.

----

There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
wall, burying the dwarves in the rubble.  You march through the hole
and find yourself in the Main Office, where a cheering band of
friendly elves carry the conquering adventurer off into the sunset.



You scored 751 out of a possible 751, using 994 turns.

All of Adventuredom gives tribute to you, Adventurer Grandmaster!

To achieve the next higher rating would be a neat trick!

CONGRATULATIONS!!
