THIS FILE CONTAINS COMPLETE SPOILERS FOR ARNA0660!

You may have to use NOSIDE. SAMOHT. to recharge the lamp.
If you do, then remember to DROP LAMP first.

Notice that ARNA0660 has "non-simulated" dwarves in the same way
as PLAT0550 and MALM1000; but also emulates LUPI0440's ability
for dwarves to tote items. The way this works is, every turn
there is a certain chance for any previously seen item anywhere
in the cave to be apported to the dwarves' storeroom, as long
as it is not in the player's location, a location forbidden to
dwarves, or a maze; and is not on a whitelist of "big" objects.
Treasures are preferred. Later, when a dwarf randomly appears,
it has a certain chance of toting any one of the items currently
in the storeroom.

LUPI0440's dwarves are essentially "cleaning up the cave"; they
won't pick up any item that's already in its proper location.
ARNA0660's dwarves do not observe that restriction.

The upshot of this mechanic is that walking past an item without
picking it up may cause it to vanish before you can come
back to it. This is particularly noticeable with the silver bars,
since they're in an area the player visits often.

The following "big" objects are safe from dwarvish pranks:
pillow, vase, rug, yacht, eggs, trident,
chest, casket, helmet, crown, sceptre, orb, chalice, tusk
sword, plate. Also the axe and the food, via special-case logic.

The food starts out nowhere, and appears in the pantry only
as part of the dwarf-spawning logic, i.e. it won't appear until
some random time after first entering the lower level of the cave.

There are three legs of the journey where the pirate can steal
a necessary treasure: trident-to-clam, eggs-to-troll, and
eggs-to-giant. So we do those as late as possible. Once the pirate
shows up for the first time, you should skip down to the
"BONUS TRIP" immediately, to disable the pirate from then on.

There are some hints here (Arthur DiBianca, 1997-09-12):

[YOU'RE IN THE CATACOMBS NOW.]
    The trick with ARNA0660's catacombs, like PLAT0550's, is that there
    are 19 rooms in a row. In each room, the "correct" direction will
    take you forward to the next room, and every other direction will
    take you backward to the previous room. In PLAT0550, the list of
    "correct" directions is hard-coded as "s sw nw s d w nw n s n sw*
    e se ne e se d s n". In ARNA0660, the "correct" direction is simply
    whatever direction you leave the room by, the first time you enter
    it. So for example you might type 18 "w"s in a row at this point
    to return to the fake Y2 room, or 18 "n"s in a row, or any set of
    18 directions. It is possible to get lost only *after* exiting the
    catacombs for the first time.
    However, after your tenth move, you must turn right (relative to the
    "correct" direction) to enter the audience hall. So you actually
    have to go through the catacombs twice: once to set the directions,
    and once to find the audience hall.
