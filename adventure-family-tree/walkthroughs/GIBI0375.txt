[YOU WIN!]

As you release the hat, a cloud of
sandalwood-scented smoke appears, out
of which steps the Grandmaster of the
Colossal Cave Lodge 437 of the Wizard's
Guild. He is wearing a long blue velvet
robe, a long, pointed bejewelled hat
made of solid platinum, and love beads.
He carries a three foot long rod with a
star on the end, all of solid gold. His
eyes twinkle behind thick gold-rimmed
spectacles, and he smiles benevolently
as he says,

"Congratulations, young Adventurer. By
your ordeals in the Cave you have
proven yourself worthy of admission to
the rank of Journeyman Wizard in the
Wizard's Guild." He places the gold
Wizard's Hat on your head and, bending,
asks,

"How do you want your name spelled on
your Certificate of Wizardness?"
_

"All right, young Wizard, your
personal Wizard Password is 'Pijqed'!"

The Wizard waves his wand, and the
cave bear and little bird appear in a
puff of orange smoke, grunting and
twittering their congratulations. You
leap onto the bear's back, and, with
the bird fluttering in a circle
overhead, you ride out of the building,
through a crowd of cheering elves, and
into the sunset.

You scored 375 out of a possible 375
using 483 turns.

All of Adventuredom gives tribute to
you, Journeyman Wizard and Adventurer
Grandmaster!

There is no higher rating!
Congratulations!!

[You can trigger the endgame without ever seeing
the stock shares. Depositing the hat without the
shares results in a score of 359 out of 375 points,
no Certificate of Wizardness, and the title of
"Apprentice Wizard and Adventurer Life Master."]
