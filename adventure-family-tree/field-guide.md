# Field guide to _Adventure_ variants

Spoilers galore ahead!

## By variant

### ARNA0660

A blend of PLAT0550 and LUPI0440.

- As in LUPI0440, dwarves can tote objects (including the little horn).

- The verb EXAMINE is supported, and all items have descriptions.

- PLAT0550's ruby yacht is located at the reservoir.

- LUPI0440's sparkling crown is replaced with an
    _amethyst encrusted crucifix of white gold_ (to avoid conflicts with
    PLAT0550's _iridium crown_).

- The food is initially nowhere, but will eventually appear
    in LUPI0440's pantry, SE and U from the Soft Room. (Food creation
    shares logic with dwarf spawning: the player must have spent some time
    "well into" the cave.)

- Arnautov extends LUPI0440's description of the room above the chapel:
    _You are in the chamber above the entrance to the chapel. A spiral
    staircase leads down, openings lead to the north and west_ (here Arnautov adds:)
    _and an arched door leads south. A rough red drawing of a fish
    can be seen above the door._ This leads to a couple of rooms that
    were implemented but inaccessible in LUPI0440:
    _You are at a window part way up a flight of stone steps. The view is
    quite beautiful - a lake with rolling green meadows beyond it, gradually
    rising to large snow-capped mountains._

- The snake blocks the SECRET exit from the Hall of the Mountain King, as well as blocking the SW exit.

- The _Galloping Ghost_ Tortoise Express has become the _Gallop-a-Ghost_ Tortoise Express.

- Going NW E from the Hall of the Mountain King leads to: _You  are in a small cubicle of red sandstone._
    (This is different from PLAT0550's _You are in a small, dank cubicle of rock_, where PLAT0550's mushroom
    was found.) UP from there leads to the chamber east of the Hall of Mists (where PLAT0550's singing sword
    was found), containing a bronze plaque reading "UIJT TQBDF JOUFOUJPOBMMZ MFGU CMBOL," which is
    Dwarvish (ROT-1) for "This space intentionally left blank." PLAT0550's mushroom has moved behind the
    spider web in the maze; you must _CUT WEB_ first. PLAT0550's sword has moved to the swirling mist
    (E N N N from the Soft Room, and then W or E with 33% chance).

- In the Witt Company Tool Room, _A pile of old rags lies discarded in one corner._
    (You must _RUB PLATE_ with these rags before passing PLAT0550's basilisk.)

- LUPI0440's "wizard's cellar" setpiece doesn't always let you keep the item you drop.
    _Through the portcullis steps a tall wizard clothed in gray.  "BE OFF!" he
    commands, raising an arm. As the scene fades, you can hear his distant
    voice adding "...DAMNED AMATEUR!..."_ Or: _"...AND TAKE YOUR JUNK WITH YOU!..."_

### ARNA0770

- Picnic table

### BRHA0017 (_A Serf's Tale_)

- Inventory limit of four "carried" items plus three in "pockets" which must be
    RETRieved before use, adding an extra level of inventory management.

- The four well-house items are instead received via difficult-to-reach
    aboveground "cutscenes": N E E E SE SE SE to get the keys, then
    RETR MAP, EXAM MAP, and N N N N N NW NW to meet the Patron at the
    Waystation and receive the lamp, flask, and sandwiches.

- XYZZY is implemented as a sort of transporter disk; STAND ON DISC, then say XYZZY.
    The magic word PLUGH has become GLUPH, and is associated with a second, _portable,_
    transporter disc.

- The pirate steals only one treasure at a time.

### GIBI0375

- There is a Medieval Room behind the tablet in the Dark Room.

### HALL0501

The same as MCDO0551, except...

- The treacherous path along the ledge to the west of Lost River leads not
    to the far side of the troll bridge, but merely to the Low Room.

- Answering YES to "With what, your bare hands?" causes you to drop all your items.

### LONG0501

- Blue Grotto, Bat Cave, Cloakroom/Wumpus, Rotunda, Devil's Chair, Fairy Grotto, Lost River Canyon,
    the Winery, the Rainbow Room

### LONG0751

- Elephant Graveyard, Leprechaun Rock, orcs at helipad

### LUPI0440

- Dwarves can tote objects. The little horn (which is not a treasure)
    is acquired only by killing the dwarf who is toting it.

- The "giant's dungeon" setpiece.

### MCDO0551

The same as LONG0501, plus the "Castle of the Elves" sequence:

- _You are on a small rise overlooking a beautiful bay. In the center
    of the bay is the castle of the elves._

### OSKA0501

The same as LONG0501, plus two uncompleted dead ends:

- _You have entered Haunted Chamber.  A cold wind whistles eerily
    throughout the room.  Strange chords from an unseen organ echo
    from all over.  A passage leads east and a small hole leads south._

- _You are in an extremely bizzare room.  The entire north wall
    glow with a luminous red light.  There are gnarled stone formations
    rising from the floor, which look like contorted staues in the
    wierd red light.  A bronze plaque on the east wall bears the
    inscription, 'Shamut'.  There is a dark tunnel to the south and an
    impossibly steep passage west._

### SWEN0448

- The brass lantern is located below grate, instead of in the well house.

- The silver bars are located north of the west side of fissure:
    _You are in a cramped chamber looking out over the fissure in the hall
    of Mists.  A tight passage leads back down. There are bars of silver here!_

- The Magician's Tower setpiece, west of the long hall:
    _You are at the west end of a very long featureless hall.  The hall
    joins up with a narrow north/south passage.  There is a narrow doorway
    leading to the west._ Go through the door:
    _You're on a spiral staircase lit by torches with an eastern door._
    Past the Magician's Chamber (see below), you find mithril chain mail
    and pass through three rooms of "dwarven mines." _You're in the
    Lower Hall of the ancient dwarven mines. There are signs of ancient
    battles all over and most of the passages out of the hall are blocked._

- The last step to the pirate's lair is usually NW, but in SWEN0448 it's SW instead.

## By attribute

### Above-ground features

- ARNA0660: A path NW of the building leads through a ravine to a magnificent view.
    The bottle has been moved there. Later the location is revealed to be the
    Giant's picnic ground.

- ARNA0770: The road west of the building leads to a white tower.
    To the east of the building: _A small wooden bird table on a
    tall wooden leg stands sheltered by the wall of the house. A small pile of
    bird seed lies on the table._

- BRHA0017: South of grate: _a dried-up waterfall atop an enormous sea-cliff.
    Below you the terrain slopes dizzyingly down to the sea, a thousand feet
    below._ There is nothing to do there besides fall off the cliff and die.

- WOOD0430: chasm

- LONG0501 (MCDO0551, LONG0751): billboard, salt marsh, Thunder Hole

### Brooms

- LONG0501 (MCDO0551, LONG0751): _You're at Tongue of Rock. There is a small whiskbroom here._
    In the dusty rock room, SWEEP reveals the combination to the safe in the Well House:
    _Brushing the dust from one of the larger rocks reveals some carved characters.
    In the rock is carved the message "7-22-34"._

- SWEN0448: _You are in a small dusty chamber which appears as though you're the
    first person to enter it in years.  The only visible exit is to the north._
    SWEEP. _As the dust is dislodged and shifts around the room a trap door
    appears in the middle of the floor._ This leads to the tunnels under the
    throne room, and a treasure.

    Separately, SWEEP in the dusty rock room reveals a treasure:
    _Your sweeping stirs up the dust and reveals a piece of paper on the
    ground._

### Crystal balls

- LIDI0366: _You are in the gazebo. The dust is deep here, indicating long disuse.
   Ancient elvish runes here describe this as a place where one may see many things.
   Another, more ancient inscription reads "PKIHMN". There is a palantir(orb) here._
   You can PEER ORB to get some useless messages.

- LUPI0440 (ARNA0660, ARNA0770): _A crystal orb lies here!_ (in the circular cellar
   SE of the Soft Room). In ARNA0660 and ARNA0770, you can EXAMINE ORB to receive
   non-essential hints re various puzzles.

- MCDO0551: _There is a polished sphere of pure quartz here!_ (in the Crystal Palace).
    LOOK BALL causes you to see whatever is in the room with the star sapphire.
    This in turn allows you to learn the magic word SAINT-MICHEL for teleporting
    to the Castle of the Elves.

### Dwarvish language

- ARNA0770: I've heard that the ability to decode ROT1 Dwarvish is used in at
    least one puzzle.

- BRHA0017: If killed by a dwarf in the dark, _somebody mutters ‘Loodybay Ouristtay!’_

- GIBI0375: _There is an ancient dog-eared Dwarvish-English dictionary here._ (at Y2)

- PLAT0550 (ARNA0660, ARNA0770): _The dwarf staggers, slumps to the ground, gasps "Epo'u mfu uifn vtf fncbmnjoh
    gmvje.  J xbou up cf tuvggfe xjui dsbc nfbu!" and then expires in a puff of oily black smoke._
    The gimmick here is that dwarves speak in ROT1: "Don't let them use embalming
    fluid. I want to be stuffed with crab meat!"

### Flying carpets

- GOET0580:

- WOOD0430: _You board the Persian rug, which promptly whisks you across the chasm._

### Garden-path sentence

- BRHA0017: _A little dwarf walks around a corner. He throws an axe at you, which misses, curses and runs off!_

- CROW0000 (WOOD0350): _A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you, threw a little axe at you which missed, cursed, and ran away._

- GIBI0375: _A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you, threw a little axe, missing you, cursed, and ran away._

- HOWE0301: _A little dwarf walked around a corner & saw you. He threw a little axe which missed then ran away._

- KNUT0350: _A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you, threw a little axe at you, cursed, and ran away. (The axe missed.)_

### Genies and djinns

- WOOD0430: _As you rub the urn, there is a flash of light and a genie appears.
    His aspect is stern as he advises: "One who wouldst traffic in
    precious stones must first learn to recognize the signals thereof."_

- PLAT0550 (GOET0580, MALM1000): _There is a small, tightly-sealed earthenware flask on the ground here.
    It has the words "London Dry" written on the side._ Drop it in the Room with Pentagram
    and a _twelve-foot Djinn_ will give you a hint to the alphabetical order in the endgame.

### Magic words

- ARNA0660: Same set as PLAT0550.
    The "skeleton key" that opens the safe is randomly one of BLERBI, KLAETU, KNERL, or SNOEZE.
    The magic word ZORTON is no longer one of the possible "skeleton keys";
    instead, it turns the singing sword into the mithril ring.

- ARNA0770: PLAT0550, plus BASINGSTOKE

- BRHA0017: XYZZY, GLUPH, PLOVER, FEE FIE FOE FOO, MAGE DEN

- LIDI0366: WOOD0350, plus PKIHMN

- LONG0501 (LONG0751): WOOD0350, plus PHUCE

- MALM1000: WOOD0350, plus ZORTON, THURB, NOSIDE SAMOHT, PHUGGG, MELENKURION.
    The "skeleton key" that opens the safe is always ZORTON.

- MCDO0551: LONG0501, plus SAINT-MICHEL

- PLAT0550: WOOD0350, plus ZORTON, THURB, SNOEZE, NOSIDE SAMOHT, PHUGGG, MELENKURION, KNERL, KLAETU, BLERBI.
    The "skeleton key" that opens the safe is randomly one of BLERBI, KLAETU, KNERL, SNOEZE, or ZORTON.

- WOOD0350 (LUPI0440): XYZZY, PLUGH, PLOVER, FEE FIE FOE FOO

### Mazes

- BRHA0017: WOOD0350. The "all alike" maze is changed: the route to the chest is
    simply SE N S, then N N N to the pit. The "all different" maze is also changed.

- CROW0000: Twisty passages all alike

- HOWE0301: WOOD0350, but the "all different" maze rooms differ by text color, not
    by description.

- LUPI0440: WOOD0350, plus spider maze (_tangled web of intersecting passages_), sewer maze

- MCDO0551: LONG0501, plus kaleidoscopic garden of the elves

- PLAT0550: WOOD0350, plus fog room, enchanted catacombs, ice maze (_THURB_)

- WOOD0350: CROW0000, plus twisty passages all different

### Musical instruments

- LUPI0440 (ARNA0660): There is a _little horn_ toted by the dwarves, which they'll drop if killed.
    You can BLOW HORN to summon a random number of angry dwarves. It has no other effect.

- LONG0501 (MCDO0551, LONG0751): The silver bars are replaced with a _delicate lyre_, which is a treasure.
    You must PLAY LYRE to get past the black dog at the Styx. The diamonds are replaced
    with a _silver horn_, which is also a treasure. You must PLAY HORN or BLOW HORN above
    the Shell Room to knock down a wall.

### Safes

- LONG0501 (MCDO0551, LONG0751): There is a wall safe in the Well House,
    initially hidden behind a poster. Most treasures must be deposited in
    the safe, rather than simply on the floor of the Well House.
    It is opened with a combination.

- MALM1000: In the Well House, _A huge steel safe has been installed
    into the brick wall on the east wall._ Opening the safe reveals a
    stairway connecting to the Programmer's Den and Computer Center.
    It is opened with a combination (using the command TURN KNOB).
    PLAT0550's _massive walk-in safe_ is also in this version.

- PLAT0550 (ARNA0660, ARNA0770, MALM1000): Below the Hall of the Mountain King,
    _A massive walk-in safe takes up one entire wall.  It is tightly
    closed, and has no handle, lock, nor keyhole._ It has a twin in the
    Peelgrunt Room on the far side of Volcano View, and is magic:
    treasures dropped in either safe are accessible from the other.
    It is opened with a magic word.

### Sword-in-stone puzzles

- LONG0501 (MCDO0551, LONG0751): Go up from the Misty Cavern to reach Sword Point.
    _Through the thick white mist looms a polished marble slab, to
    which is affixed an enormous rusty iron anvil.  In golden letters
    are written the words: "Whoso Pulleth Out This Sword of This
    Stone and Anvil, is Rightwise King-Born of All This Mountain."_
    You must either OIL SWORD; GET SWORD, or else WEAR CROWN; YANK SWORD.

- GIBI0375: Push the tablet in the Dark Room to reach the Medieval Room.
    _You are in a large room with medieval furnishings. Two bleached
    skeletons are hanging on the wall in iron cuffs. The room is
    dominated by a huge white boulder near the west wall. [...]
    A very rusty sword with a ruby-studded hilt is embedded in
    the boulder!_
    GET SWORD succeeds, but a cave-in blocks the passage back out.

- PLAT0550 (MALM1000): _You are in a small chamber to the east of the Hall of Mists.
    The walls are composed of rough red sandstone. There is a large,
    cubical chunk of rock in the center of the room.
    There is a sword here with its blade plunged deep into the block
    of stone. The sword is singing quietly to itself._ You must EAT MUSHROOM
    to acquire the strength to GET SWORD.
    _The singing sword slides easily out of the rock._
    ARNA0660 (ARNA0770) has the same puzzle with slightly altered geography.

- SWEN0448: _You are in a large chamber decorated like an ancient Druid temple
    continuing to the west with passages leading off to the north and south.
    A large stone dominates the center of the room.
    The sword is firmly imbedded in the stone!_ WEAR CROWN; PULL SWORD.
    _Voila!  The sword has slid effortlessly out of the stone._

## Vending machines

- BRHA0017: _You are at a dead-end. Built into the far wall is a strange,
    black and copper-coloured receptacle with a sign posted above it._
    READ SIGN: _‘DWARFACELL’ LAMP RE-CHARGING STATION: Insert coin and wait for instructions._
    There is a non-treasure _coin_.

- LONG0501 (MCDO0551): The _lead slugs_ from the gnome's phone booth can also be used
    in the vending machine.

- WOOD0350 (LONG0501, PLAT0550, etc): _There is a massive vending machine here. The instructions on it read:
    "Drop coins here to receive fresh batteries."_

## Wizards

- LUPI0440 (ARNA0660, ARNA0770): The "wizard's cellar" setpiece. There is a _circular cellar_
    where you must drop any item in order to be evicted by the wizard.
    _Through the portcullis steps a tall wizard clothed in grey. "Be Off!"
    he commands, raising an arm. As the scene fades his distant voice
    continues "And take your belongings with you!"._

- SWEN0448: _You're in the Magician's Chamber,
    a large pentagonal room with a spiral staircase leading up from the center of the room.
    The magician's staff is leaning against the wall.
    The Magician is here gesturing frantically in front of the elven door.
    There is a massive stone Elven door set into the western wall.
    The surface of the door is covered with indecipherable runes._
    You must THROW DAGGER to kill the magician, then speak FRIEND to enter.

    _You're in the magician's tower, a small cluttered room filled with
    all manner of strange artifacts, the purpose of which cannot be
    kenned immediately.  The walls of the chamber are themselves cloaked
    in shadows which seem to move of their own accord.  There is one
    small window in the wall but it is far over your head and lets in
    a minimum of light.  Torches set in the wall across from the window
    supplement the meager light but the entire room seems to disapprove
    of light and gloom clings to all the corners.  In the center of the
    room a spiral staircase descends into to the lower levels of the cave._

- WOOD0350: The wizard appears only to terminate a "demo game" that has exceeded
    the maximum turn count. _A large cloud of green smoke appears in front of you.
    It clears away to reveal a tall wizard, clothed in grey. He fixes you with a steely
    glare and declares, "This adventure has lasted too long." With that he makes a
    single pass over you with his hands, and everything around you fades away into
    a grey nothingness._ Non-demo games never encounter this wizard.
