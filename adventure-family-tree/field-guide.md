# Field guide to _Adventure_ variants

Spoilers galore ahead!

## By variant

### GIBI0375

- There is a Medieval Room behind the tablet in the Dark Room.

### HALL0501

The same as MCDO0551, except...

- The treacherous path along the ledge to the west of Lost River leads not
    to the far side of the troll bridge, but merely to the Low Room.

- Answering YES to "With what, your bare hands?" causes you to drop all your items.

### LONG0501

- Blue Grotto, Bat Cave, Cloakroom/Wumpus, Rotunda, Devil's Chair, Fairy Grotto, Lost River Canyon,
    the Winery, the Rainbow Room

### LONG0751

- Elephant Graveyard, Leprechaun Rock, orcs at helipad

### MCDO0551

The same as LONG0501, plus the "Castle of the Elves" sequence:

- _You are on a small rise overlooking a beautiful bay. In the center
    of the bay is the castle of the elves._

### OSKA0501

The same as LONG0501, plus two uncompleted dead ends:

- _You have entered Haunted Chamber.  A cold wind whistles eerily
    throughout the room.  Strange chords from an unseen organ echo
    from all over.  A passage leads east and a small hole leads south._

- _You are in an extremely bizzare room.  The entire north wall
    glow with a luminous red light.  There are gnarled stone formations
    rising from the floor, which look like contorted staues in the
    wierd red light.  A bronze plaque on the east wall bears the
    inscription, 'Shamut'.  There is a dark tunnel to the south and an
    impossibly steep passage west._


## By attribute

### Above-ground features

- ARNA0660: A path NW of the building leads through a ravine to a magnificent view,
    the bottle has been moved there. The road west of the building leads to a
    white tower. To the east of the building: _A small wooden bird table on a
    tall wooden leg stands sheltered by the wall of the house. A small pile of
    bird seed lies on the table._

- WOOD0430: chasm

- LONG0501 (MCDO0551, LONG0751): billboard, salt marsh, Thunder Hole

### Crystal balls

- LIDI0366: _You are in the gazebo. The dust is deep here, indicating long disuse.
   Ancient elvish runes here describe this as a place where one may see many things.
   Another, more ancient inscription reads "PKIHMN". There is a palantir(orb) here._
   You can PEER ORB to get some useless messages.

- LUPI0440: _A crystal orb lies here!_

- MCDO0551: _There is a polished sphere of pure quartz here!_ (in the Crystal Palace).
    LOOK BALL causes you to see whatever is in the room with the star sapphire.
    This in turn allows you to learn the magic word SAINT-MICHEL for teleporting
    to the Castle of the Elves.

### Dwarvish language

- GIBI0375: _There is an ancient dog-eared Dwarvish-English dictionary here._ (at Y2)

- PLAT0550: _The dwarf staggers, slumps to the ground, gasps "Epo'u mfu uifn vtf fncbmnjoh
    gmvje.  J xbou up cf tuvggfe xjui dsbc nfbu!" and then expires in a puff of oily black smoke._
    The gimmick here is that dwarves speak in ROT1: "Don't let them use embalming
    fluid. I want to be stuffed with crab meat!"

- ARNA0660, ARNA0770: I've heard that the ability to decode ROT1 Dwarvish is used in at
    least one puzzle.

### Flying carpets

- WOOD0430: _You board the Persian rug, which promptly whisks you across the chasm._

- GOET0580:

### Garden-path sentence

- CROW0000 (WOOD0350): _A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you, threw a little axe at you which missed, cursed, and ran away._

- KNUT0350: _A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you, threw a little axe at you, cursed, and ran away. (The axe missed.)_

- GIBI0375: _A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you, threw a little axe, missing you, cursed, and ran away._

### Genies and djinns

- WOOD0430: _As you rub the urn, there is a flash of light and a genie appears.
    His aspect is stern as he advises: "One who wouldst traffic in
    precious stones must first learn to recognize the signals thereof."_

- PLAT0550 (GOET0580, MALM1000): _There is a small, tightly-sealed earthenware flask on the ground here.
    It has the words "London Dry" written on the side._ Drop it in the Room with Pentagram
    and a _twelve-foot Djinn_ will give you a hint to the alphabetical order in the endgame.

### Magic words

- LIDI0366: PKIHMN

- LONG0501 (MCDO0551, LONG0751): PHUCE

- MCDO0551: SAINT-MICHEL

- PLAT0550: ZORTON, THURB, SNOEZE, NOSIDE SAMOHT, PHUGGG, MELENKURION, KNERL, KLAETU, BLERBI

- WOOD0350: XYZZY, PLUGH, PLOVER, FEE FIE FOE FOO

### Musical instruments

- LUPI0440: There is a _little horn_ toted by the dwarves, which they'll drop if killed.
    You can BLOW HORN to summon a random number of angry dwarves. It has no other effect.

- LONG0501 (MCDO0551, LONG0751): The silver bars are replaced with a _delicate lyre_, which is a treasure.
    You must PLAY LYRE to get past the black dog at the Styx. The diamonds are replaced
    with a _silver horn_, which is also a treasure. You must PLAY HORN or BLOW HORN above
    the Shell Room to knock down a wall.

### Sword-in-stone puzzles

- LONG0501 (MCDO0551, LONG0751): Go up from the Misty Cavern to reach Sword Point.
    _Through the thick white mist looms a polished marble slab, to
    which is affixed an enormous rusty iron anvil.  In golden letters
    are written the words: "Whoso Pulleth Out This Sword of This
    Stone and Anvil, is Rightwise King-Born of All This Mountain."_
    You must either OIL SWORD; GET SWORD, or else WEAR CROWN; YANK SWORD.

- GIBI0375: Push the tablet in the Dark Room to reach the Medieval Room.
    _You are in a large room with medieval furnishings. Two bleached
    skeletons are hanging on the wall in iron cuffs. The room is
    dominated by a huge white boulder near the west wall. [...]
    A very rusty sword with a ruby-studded hilt is embedded in
    the boulder!_
    GET SWORD succeeds, but a cave-in blocks the passage back out.

## Wizards

- LUPI0440 (ARNA0660, ARNA0770): The "wizard's cellar" setpiece. There is a _circular cellar_
    where you must drop any item in order to be evicted by the wizard.
    _Through the portcullis steps a tall wizard clothed in grey. "Be Off!"
    he commands, raising an arm. As the scene fades his distant voice
    continues "And take your belongings with you!"._

- WOOD0350: The wizard appears only to terminate a "demo game" that has exceeded
    the maximum turn count. _A large cloud of green smoke appears in front of you.
    It clears away to reveal a tall wizard, clothed in grey. He fixes you with a steely
    glare and declares, "This adventure has lasted too long." With that he makes a
    single pass over you with his hands, and everything around you fades away into
    a grey nothingness._ Non-demo games never encounter this wizard.
