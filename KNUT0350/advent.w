@* Introduction. The ur-game for computers --- Adventure --- was originally
written by Will Crowther in 1975 or 1976 and significantly extended by
@^Crowther, William R.@>
Don Woods in 1977. I have taken Woods's original {\mc FORTRAN} program
@^Woods, Donald Roy@>
for Adventure Version~1.0 and recast it in the \.{CWEB} idiom.

I remember being fascinated by this game when John McCarthy showed it
to me in 1977. I started with no clues about the purpose of the game
@^McCarthy, John@>
@^Knuth, Donald Ervin@>
or what I should do; just the computer's comment that I was at the
end of a forest road facing a small brick building. Little by little,
the game revealed its secrets, just as its designers had cleverly plotted.
What a thrill it was when I first got past the green snake! Clearly the
game was potentially addictive, so I forced myself to stop playing ---
reasoning that it was great fun, sure, but traditional computer science
research is great fun too, possibly even more so.

Now here I am, 21 years later, returning to the great Adventure after
having indeed had many exciting adventures in Computer Science. I~believe
people who have played this game will be able to extend their fun by
reading its once-secret program. Of course I urge everybody to {\it play the
game first, at least ten times}, before reading on. But you cannot
fully appreciate the astonishing brilliance of its design until
you have seen all of the surprises that have been built in.

I believe this program is entirely faithful to the behavior of Adventure
Version~1.0, except that I have slightly edited the computer messages
(mostly so that they use both lowercase and uppercase letters). I have also
omitted Woods's elaborate machinery for closing the cave during the hours
of prime-time computing; I believe John McCarthy insisted on this, when
@^McCarthy, John@>
he saw the productivity of his AI Lab falling off dramatically---although
it is rumored that he had a special version of the program that
allowed him to play whenever he wanted. And I have
not adopted the encryption scheme by which Woods made it difficult for
users to find any important clues in
the binary program file or core image; such
modifications would best be done by making a special version of \.{CTANGLE}.
All of the spelunking constraints and interactive behavior have
been retained, although the structure of this \.{CWEB} program is
naturally quite different from the {\mc FORTRAN} version that I began~with.

Many of the phrases in the following documentation have been lifted directly
from comments in the {\mc FORTRAN} code. Please regard me as merely
a translator of the program, not as an author. I thank Don Woods for
helping me check the validity of this translation.

By the way, if you don't like |goto| statements, don't read this. (And don't
read any other programs that simulate multistate systems.)

@* The vocabulary. Throughout the remainder of this documentation, ``you'' are
the user and ``we'' are the game author and the computer. We don't tell you
what words to use, except indirectly; but we try to understand enough words of
English so that you can play without undue frustration. The first part of the
program specifies what we know about your language --- about 300 words.

@ When you type a word, we first convert uppercase letters to lowercase; then
we chop off all but the first five characters, if the word was longer than
that, and we look for your word in a small hash table. Each hash table entry
contains a string of length 5~or~less, and two additional bytes for the word's
type and meaning. Four types of words are distinguished: |motion_type|,
|object_type|, |action_type|, and |message_type|.

@s wordtype int

typedef struct {
  char text[6]; /* string of length at most 5 */
  char word_type; /* a |wordtype| */
  char meaning;
} hash_entry;

@ Here is the subroutine that puts words into our vocabulary, when the
program is getting ready to run.

  for (h=0,p=w;*p;p++) h=*p+h+h;
  h%=hash_prime;
  while (hash_table[h].word_type) {
    h++;@+if (h==hash_prime) h=0;
  }
  strcpy(hash_table[h].text,w);

  hash_table[h].meaning=m;
}

@ @<Glob...@>=
hash_entry hash_table[hash_prime]; /* the table of words we know */
wordtype current_type; /* the kind of word we are dealing with */

@ While we're at it, let's write the program that will look up a word.
It returns the location of the word in the hash table, or $-1$ if
you've given a word like `\.{tickle}' or `\.{terse}' that is unknown.

    if (streq(w,hash_table[h].text)) return h;
    h++;@+if (h==hash_prime) h=0;
  }
  return -1;
}

permitted. Here is a list of their possible meanings.

char *message[13]; /* messages tied to certain vocabulary words */

@* Cave data. You might be in any of more than 100 places as you wander
about in Colossal Cave. Let's enumerate them now, so that we can
build the data structures that define the travel restrictions.
@^Colossal Cave@>

A special negative value called |inhand| is the location code for objects that
you are carrying. But you yourself are always situated in a place that has a
nonnegative location code.

Nonnegative places |<=outside| are outside the cave, while places |>=inside|
are inside.  The upper part of the cave, places |<emist|, is the easiest part
to explore.  (We will see later that dwarves do not venture this close to the
surface; they stay |>=emist|.)

Places between |inside| and |dead2|, inclusive, form the main cave;
the next places, up to and including |barr|, form the hidden cave on the
other side of the troll bridge; then |neend| and |swend| are a private cave.

The remaining places, |>=crack|, are dummy locations,
not really part of the maze. As soon as you arrive at a dummy
location, the program immediately sends you somewhere else.
In fact, the last three dummy locations aren't really even locations;
they invoke special code.
This device is a convenient way to provide a variety of features without
making the program logic any more cluttered than it already is.

@ Speaking of program logic, the complex cave dynamics are essentially
kept in a table. The table tells us what to do when you ask for a particular
motion in a particular location. Each entry of the table is called
an instruction; and each instruction has three parts: a motion,
a condition, and a destination.

The motion part of an instruction is one of the motion verbs enumerated
earlier.

The condition part $c$ is a small integer, interpreted as follows:
\xdef\instspecs{\secno}

\smallskip
\item{$\bullet$}if $c=0$, the condition is always true;
\item{$\bullet$}if $0<c<100$, the condition is true with probability $c/100$;
\item{$\bullet$}if $c=100$, the condition is always true, except for dwarves;
\item{$\bullet$}if $100<c<=200$, you must have object $c\bmod100$;
\item{$\bullet$}if $200<c<=300$, object $c\bmod100$ must be in the current place;
\item{$\bullet$}if $300<c<=400$, $|prop|[c\bmod100]$ must not be 0;
\item{$\bullet$}if $400<c<=500$, $|prop|[c\bmod100]$ must not be 1;
\item{$\bullet$}if $500<c<=600$, $|prop|[c\bmod100]$ must not be 2; etc.
\smallskip
\noindent (We will discuss properties of objects and the |prop| array
later.)

The destination $d$ is either a location or a number greater than
|max_loc|. In the latter case, if |d<=max_spec| we perform a special
routine; otherwise we print |remarks[d-max_spec]| and
stay in the current place.

\def\getsecno#1#2{\getsecn#2}
\def\getsecn$\X#1:#2\X${#1}
If the motion matches what you said but the condition is not satisfied,
we move on to the next instruction that has a different destination and/or
condition from this one. The next instruction might itself be
conditional in the same way; but the motion is no longer checked after
it has first been matched. (Numerous examples appear below;
complete details of the table-driven logic can be found in section
\getsecno|@<Determine the next...@>|.)

@<Type...@>=
typedef struct {
  motion mot; /* a motion you might have requested */
  int cond; /* if you did, this condition must also hold */
  location dest; /* and if so, this is where you'll go next */
} instruction;

@ Suppose you're at location $l$. Then |start[l]| is the first
relevant instruction, and |start[l+1]-1| is the last. Also
|long_desc[l]| is a string that fully describes~$l$; |short_desc[l]|
is an optional abbreviated description; and |visits[l]| tells how
many times you have been here. Special properties of this location,
such as whether a lantern is necessary or a hint might be advisable,
are encoded in the bits of |flags[l]|.

not permitted.'' It keeps them out of the following maze, which is
based on an $11\times11$ latin square. (Each of the eleven locations
leads to each of the others under the ten motions |N|, |S|, |E|, |W|,
|NE|, |SE|, |NW|, |SW|, |U|, |D| --- except that |diff0| goes down to
the entrance location |wlong| instead of to |diff10|, and |diff10| goes
south to the dead-end location |pony| instead of to |diff0|. Furthermore,
each location is accessible from all ten possible directions.)

Incidentally, if you ever get into a ``little twisting maze of
passages,'' you're really lost.

@* Data structures for objects. A fixed universe of objects was
enumerated in the vocabulary section. Most of the objects can move
or be moved from place to place; so we maintain linked lists of the
objects at each location. The first object at location~|l| is |first[l]|,
then comes |link[first[l]]|, then |link[link[first[l]]]|, etc.,
ending with~0 (which is the ``object'' called |NOTHING|).

Some of the objects are placed in {\it groups\/} of one or more objects.
In such cases |base[t]| is the smallest object in the group containing
object~|t|. Objects that belong to groups are immovable; they always
stay in the same location. Other objects have |base[t]=NOTHING| and they
are free to leave one list and join another. For example, it turns
out that the |KEYS| are movable, but the |SNAKE| is always in the
Hall of the Mountain King; we set |base[KEYS]=NOTHING| and |base[SNAKE]=SNAKE|.
Several groups, such as the |GRATE| and |GRATE_|, consist of two objects.
This program supports operations on groups of more than two objects,
but no such objects actually occur.

Each movable or base object |t| has a current property |prop[t]|,
which is initially~$-1$ for treasures, otherwise initially~0.
We change |prop[t]| to~0 when you first
see treasure~|t|; and property values often change further as the game
progresses. For example, the |PLANT| can grow. When you see an object,
we usually print a message that corresponds to its current property value.
That message is the string |note[prop[t]+offset[t]]|.

(Exception: When you first see the |RUG| or the |CHAIN|, its property
value is set to~1, not~0. The reason for this hack is that you get
maximum score only if the property values of all treasures are
zero when you finish.)

Each object is in at most one list, |place[t]|.
If you are carrying object~|t|, the value of |place[t]| is~|inhand|,
which is negative.
The special location |limbo| has value~0;
we don't maintain a list |first[limbo]| for objects that have
|place[t]=limbo|. Thus object~|t| is in a list if and only if |place[t]>0|.
The global variable |holding| counts how many objects you are carrying.

One more array completes our set of data structures:
Objects that appear in inventory reports have a name, |name[t]|.

@d toting(t) (place[t]<0)

@<Glob...@>=
object first[max_loc+1]; /* the first object present at a location */
object link[max_obj+1]; /* the next object present in the same location */
object base[max_obj+2]; /* the smallest object in each object's group, if any */
int prop[max_obj+1]; /* each object's current property value */
location place[max_obj+1]; /* each object's current location */
char *name[max_obj+1]; /* name of object for inventory listing */
char *note[100]; /* descriptions of object properties */
int offset[max_obj+1]; /* where notes for each object start */
int holding; /* how many objects have |place[t]<0|? */
int note_ptr=0; /* how many notes have we stored? */

@ Here then is a simple subroutine to place an object at a given
location, when the object isn't presently in a list.

@<Sub...@>=
void drop @,@,@[ARGS((object,location))@];
void drop(t,l)
  object t;
  location l;
{
  if (toting(t)) holding--;
  place[t]=l;
  if (l<0) holding++;
  else if (l>0) {
    link[t]=first[l];
    first[l]=t;
  }
}

@ Similarly, we need a subroutine to pick up an object.

@d move(t,l) @+{@+carry(t);@+drop(t,l);@+}
@d destroy(t) move(t,limbo)

@<Sub...@>=
void carry @,@,@[ARGS((object))@];
void carry(t)
  object t;
{@+register location l=place[t];
  if (l>=limbo) {
    place[t]=inhand;
    holding++;
    if (l>limbo) {
      register object r,s;
      for (r=0,s=first[l];s!=t;r=s,s=link[s]) ;
      if (r==0) first[l]=link[s];
      else link[r]=link[s]; /* remove |t| from list */
    }
  }
}

@ The |is_at_loc| subroutine tests if a possibly multipart object is
at a particular place, represented by the global variable |loc|.
It uses the fact that multipart objects
have consecutive values, and |base[max_obj+1]==NOTHING|.

@<Sub...@>=
boolean is_at_loc @,@,@[ARGS((object))@];
boolean is_at_loc(t)
  object t;
{ register object tt;
  if (base[t]==NOTHING) return place[t]==loc;
  for (tt=t;base[tt]==t;tt++) if (place[tt]==loc) return true;
  return false;
}

@ A few macros make it easy to get each object started.

@d new_obj(t,n,b,l) { /* object |t| named |n| with base |b| starts at |l| */
  name[t]=n;
  base[t]=b;
  offset[t]=note_ptr;
  prop[t]=(is_treasure(t)? -1: 0);
  drop(t,l);  
}

@d new_note(n) note[note_ptr++]=n

@ @<Additional local registers@>=
register object t;

@* Object data. Now it's time to build the object structures just
defined.

We put the objects into their initial locations backwards,
that is, highest first; moreover, we place all two-part objects
before placing the others. Then low-numbered objects will appear first in
the list, and two-part objects will appear last.

Here are the two-part objects, which are mostly unnamed because you won't
be picking them up.

@* Low-level input. Sometimes we need to ask you a question, for which
the answer is either yes or no. The subroutine |yes(q,y,n)| prints~|q|,

answer. It returns a nonzero value if your answer was affirmative.

@* The main control loop. Now we've got enough low-level mechanisms in
place to start thinking of the program from the top down, and to
specify the high-level control.

A global variable |loc| represents where you currently live in the
simulated cave. Another variable |newloc| represents where you will
go next, unless something like a dwarf blocks you. We also keep
track of |oldloc| (the previous value of |loc|) and |oldoldloc|
(the previous previous value), for use when you ask to `\.{go} \.{back}'.

@d here(t) (toting(t) || place[t]==loc) /* is object |t| present? */
@d water_here ((flags[loc]&(liquid+oil))==liquid)
@d oil_here   ((flags[loc]&(liquid+oil))==liquid+oil)
@d no_liquid_here ((flags[loc]&liquid)==0)

@<Glob...@>=
location oldoldloc,oldloc,loc,newloc; /* recent and future locations */

@ Here is our overall strategy for administering the game. It is understood
that the program might |goto quit| from within any of the subsections
named here, even though the section names don't mention this explicitly.
For example, while checking for interference we might find out that
time has run out, or that a dwarf has killed you and no more
reincarnations are possible.

The execution consists of two nested loops: There are ``minor
cycles'' inside of ``major cycles.'' Actions define minor cycles in which
you stay in the same place and we tell you the result of your action.
Motions define major cycles in which you move and we tell you what you
can see at the new place.

@<Simulate...@>=
while (1) {
  @<Check for interference with the proposed move to |newloc|@>;
  loc=newloc; /* hey, we actually moved you */
  @<Possibly move dwarves and the pirate@>;
 commence: @<Report the current state@>;
  while (1) {
    @<Get user input; |goto try_move| if motion is requested@>;
    @<Perform an action in the current place@>;
  }
 try_move: @<Handle special motion words@>;
  oldoldloc=oldloc;
  oldloc=loc;
 go_for_it: @<Determine the next location, |newloc|@>;
}

@ Our main task in the simulation loop is to parse your input.
Depending on the kind of command you give, the following section
of the program will exit in one of four ways:

\smallskip
\item{$\bullet$} |goto try_move| with |mot| set to a desired motion.

\item{$\bullet$} |goto transitive| with |verb| set to a desired action
and |obj| set to the object of that action.

\item{$\bullet$} |goto intransitive| with |verb| set to a desired action
and |obj=NOTHING|; no object has been specified.

\item{$\bullet$} |goto speakit| with |hash_table[k].meaning| the
index of a message for a vocabulary word of |message_type|.

\smallskip\noindent
Sometimes we have to ask you to complete an ambiguous command before we
know both a verb and its object. In most cases the words can be in
either order; for example, \.{take} \.{rod} is equivalent to \.{rod} \.{take}.
A~motion word overrides a previously given action or object.

Lots of special cases make the program a bit messy. For example,
if the verb is \.{say}, we don't want to look up the object in our
vocabulary; we simply want to ``say'' it.

@ Here is the multiway branch where many kinds of actions can be launched.

If a verb can only be transitive, but no object has been given,
we must go back and ask for an object.

If a verb can only be intransitive, but an object has been given,
we issue the default message for that verb and start over.

in several of the action routines.

oil, otherwise either 1 or~$-2$. (The value $-2$ is used after closing the

@* Random numbers. You won't realize it until you have played the game
for awhile, but adventures in Colossal Cave are not deterministic. Lots of
things can happen differently when you give the same input, because
caves are continually changing, and the dwarves don't have
consistent aim, etc.

A simple linear congruential method is used to provide numbers that
are random enough for our purposes.

@<Sub...@>=
int ran @,@,@[ARGS((int))@];
int ran(range)
  int range; /* for uniform integers between 0 and |range-1| */
{
  rx=(1021*rx)&0xfffff; /* multiply by 1021, modulo $2^{20}$ */
  return (range*rx)>>20;
}

@ @<Glob...@>=
int rx; /* the last random value generated */

@ Each run is different.

@<Initialize the random number generator@>=
rx=(((int)time(NULL))&0xfffff)|1;

@ The |pct| macro returns true a given percentage of the time.

@d pct(r) (ran(100)<r)

@<Give optional \.{plugh} hint@>=
if (loc==y2 && pct(25) && !closing)
  printf("A hollow voice says \"PLUGH\".\n");

@ We kick the random number generator often, just to add variety to the chase.

@<Make special adjustments before looking at new input@>+=
k=ran(0);

@* Dwarf stuff. We've said a lot of vague stuff about dwarves; now is the time
to be explicit. Five dwarves roam about the cave. Initially they are
dormant but eventually they each walk about at random.
A global variable called |dflag| governs their level of activity:
$$\vcenter{\halign{#\quad&#\hfil\cr
0&no dwarf stuff yet (we wait until you reach the Hall of Mists)\cr
1&you've reached that hall, but haven't met the first dwarf\cr
2&you've met one; the others start moving, but no knives thrown yet\cr
3&a knife has been thrown, but it misses\cr
4&knives will hit you with probability .095\cr
5&knives will hit you with probability .190\cr
6&knives will hit you with probability .285\cr}}$$
and so on. Dwarves get madder and madder as |dflag| increases; this
increases their accuracy.

A pirate stalks the cave too. He acts a lot like a dwarf with respect to
random walks, so we call him |dwarf[0]|, but actually he is quite different.
He starts at the location of his treasure chest; you won't see that chest
until after you've spotted him.

The present location of |dwarf[i]| is |dloc[i]|; initially no two
dwarves are adjacent. The value of
|dseen[i]| records whether or not dwarf~|i| is following you.

@d nd 5 /* this many dwarves */
@d chest_loc dead2
@d message_loc pony

@<Glob...@>=
int dflag; /* how angry are the dwarves? */
int dkill; /* how many of them have you killed? */
location dloc[nd+1]={chest_loc,hmk,wfiss,y2,like3,complex}; /* dwarf locations */
location odloc[nd+1]; /* prior locations */
boolean dseen[nd+1]; /* have you been spotted? */

@ The following subroutine is often useful.

{
  register int j;
  if (dflag<2) return false;
  for (j=1;j<=nd;j++) if (dloc[j]==loc) return true;
  return false;
}

@ Just after you've moved to a new |loc|, we move the other guys.
But we bypass all dwarf motion if you are in a place forbidden
to the pirate, or if your next motion is forced. In particular,
this means that the pirate can't steal the return toll, and
dwarves can't meet the bear.  It also means that dwarves won't
follow you into a dead end of the maze, but c'est la vie; they'll
wait for you outside the dead end.

  } else @<Move dwarves and the pirate@>;
}

@ When level 2 is reached, we silently kill 0, 1, or 2 of the dwarves.
Then if any of the survivors is in the current location, we move him
to |nugget|; thus no dwarf is presently tracking you. Another
dwarf does, however, toss an axe and grumpily leave the scene.

(The grumpy dwarf might throw the axe while you're in the maze of
all-different twists, even though other dwarves never go in there!)

axe at you, cursed, and ran away.  (The axe missed.)\n");
  drop(AXE,loc);
}

@ It turns out that the only way you can get rid of a dwarf is to

the axe will be available for reuse.

@* Closing the cave. You get to wander around until you've located all
fifteen treasures, although you need not have taken them yet. After that,
you enter a new level of complexity: A global variable called
|clock1| starts ticking downwards, every time you take a turn inside the cave.
When it hits zero, we start closing the cave; then we sit back and
wait for you to try to get out, letting |clock2| do the ticking.
The initial value of |clock1| is large enough for you to get outside.

@d closing (clock1<0)

@<Glob...@>=
int clock1=15, clock2=30; /* clocks that govern closing time */
boolean panic,closed; /* various stages of closedness */

@ Location Y2 is virtually outside the cave, so |clock1| doesn't tick there.
If you stay outside the cave with all your treasures, and with the lamp
switched off, the game might go on forever; but you wouldn't be having
any fun.

There's an interesting hack by which you can keep |tally| positive
until you've taken all the treasures out of the cave. Namely, if your
first moves are
$$\vcenter{\halign{\hfil\hbox{#}\hfil\cr
\.{in},\quad \.{take} \.{lamp},\quad \.{plugh},\quad \.{on},\quad \.{drop} \.{lamp},\quad \.s,\quad
 \.{take} \.{silver},\cr
\.{back},\quad \.{take} \.{lamp},\quad \.{plugh},\quad \.{out},\quad
 \.{drop} \.{silver},\quad \.{in},\cr}}$$
the silver bars will be at |road|; but |prop[SILVER]| will still be~$-1$
and |tally| will still be~15. You can bring the other 14 treasures to the
|house| at your leisure; then the |tally| will drop to zero when you step
outside and actually see the silver for the first time.

@<Check the clocks and the lamp@>=

}

@ At the time of first warning, we lock the grate, destroy the crystal bridge,
kill all the dwarves (and the pirate), remove the troll and the bear
(unless dead), and set |closing| to true. It's too much trouble to move
the dragon, so we leave it. From now on until |clock2| runs out, you
cannot unlock the grate, move to any location outside the cave, or
create the bridge. Nor can you be resurrected if you die.

@<Warn that the cave is closing@>=

  printf("A mysterious recorded voice groans into life and announces:\n\
\"This exit is closed.  Please leave via main office.\"\n");
}

@ Finally, after |clock2| hits zero, we transport you to the final puzzle,
which takes place in the previously inaccessible storage room. We have to
set everything up anew, in order to use the existing machinery instead
of writing a special program. We are careful not to include keys
in the room, since we don't want to allow you to unlock the grate that
separates you from your treasures. There is no water; otherwise we
would need special code for watering the beanstalks.

The storage room has two locations, |neend| and |swend|. At the northeast
end, we place empty bottles, a nursery of plants, a bed of oysters, a pile
of lamps, rods with stars, sleeping dwarves, and you. At the southwest end
we place a grate, a snake pit, a covey of caged birds, more rods, and
pillows. A mirror stretches across one wall. But we destroy all objects
you might be carrying, lest you have some that could cause trouble,
such as the keys.  We describe the flash of light and trundle back.

From the fact that you've seen all the treasures, we can infer that
the snake is already gone, since the jewels are accessible only from
the Hall of the Mountain King. We also know that you've been in the
Giant Room (to get eggs); you've discovered that the clam is
an oyster (because of the pearl); the dwarves have been activated,
since you've found the chest. Therefore the long descriptions of
|neend| and |swend| will make sense to you when you see them.

When you die, |newloc| is undefined (often |limbo|)
and |oldloc| is what killed you.
So we look at |oldoldloc|, the last place you were safe.

number of deaths you have had so~far.

that the bird is dropped before the cage. The lamp is a special case,
because we wouldn't want to leave it underground; we turn it off and
leave it outside the building---only if you were carrying it, of course.
You yourself are left {\it inside\/} the building. (Heaven help you

@* Scoring. Here is the scoring algorithm we use:
$$\vcenter{\halign{#\hfil&&\hskip5em\hfil#\cr
\hfil\it Objective&\hidewidth\it Points\hfil\hidewidth
  &\hidewidth\it Total possible\hfil\hidewidth\cr
\noalign{\vskip2pt}
Getting well into cave&   25&  25\cr
Each treasure $<$ chest&  12&  60\cr
Treasure chest itself&    14&  14\cr
Each treasure $>$ chest&  16& 144\cr
Each unused death&        10&  30\cr
Not quitting&              4&   4\cr
Reaching Witt's End&       1&   1\cr
Getting to |closing|&     25&  25\cr
Various additional bonuses& &  45\cr
Round out the total&       2&   2\cr
\noalign{\vskip2pt}
          &&\llap{Total:\quad}350\cr
}}$$
Points can also be deducted for using hints. One consequence of these
rules is that you get 32 points just for quitting on your first turn.
And there's a way to get 57 points in just three turns.

Full points for treasures are awarded only if they aren't broken and
you have deposited them in the building. But we give you 2 points just for
seeing a treasure.

@d max_score 350

@<Glob...@>=
int bonus; /* extra points awarded for exceptional adventuring skills */

@ The hints are table driven, using several arrays:

\item{$\bullet$} |hint_count[j]|
is the number of recent turns whose location is relevant to hint~|j|;

\item{$\bullet$} |hint_thresh[j]| is the number of such turns before
we consider offering that hint;

\item{$\bullet$} |hint_cost[j]| is the number of points you pay for it;

\item{$\bullet$} |hint_prompt[j]| is the way we offer it;

\item{$\bullet$} |hint[j]| is the hint;

\item{$\bullet$} |hinted[j]| is true after we've given it.

\medskip\noindent
Hint 0 is for instructions at the beginning; it costs you 5 points, but
you get extra power in the lamp. The other hints also usually extend the lamp's
power. Hint~1 is for reading the oyster. And hints 2 through~7 are for the
|cave_hint|, |bird_hint|, |snake_hint|, |twist_hint|, |dark_hint|,
and |witt_hint|, respectively.

Here's the subroutine that handles all eight kinds of hints.

@<Sub...@>=

}

declares, ``This adventure has lasted too long.'' With that he makes a single
pass over you with his hands, and everything around you fades away into a grey
nothingness.
