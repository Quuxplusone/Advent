Welcome to Myrkraverk's Adventure 5!

Before playing this game, see BUGS below!!!

Send bug reports, comments, or just plain bitching to Johann Oskarsson
<myrkraverk@users.sourceforge.net>

This is a port of very old sources in FORTRAN IV to GNU g77.  This is
meant for a unix system, so I guess some fiddling with the automake
stuff is requried for a non-unix installation; it should be okay to
'make' and then just run the game in the 'src' directory though.

For installation instructions, see INSTALL.

For copyright information, see COPYING (this is not GPL)

The file doc/README.SRC is the readme that came with the origial sources.


BUGS
====

The map maker is currently a no-no, so you will have to answer `no' to
a new map (the very first question) otherwise the game will crash!

The SAVE command will most likely just crash your game.

Sometimes, the game will show garbage instead of something you typed
in, this does not hinder gameplay, but you should let me know about
it.

...and probably a lot more that I haven't found yet :)
