1       You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.
1       Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows out of the building and
1       down a gully.
2       You have walked up a hill, still in the forest.  The road slopes back
2       down the other side of the hill.  There is a building in the distance.
3       You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring.  Off
3       to one side is a small pantry.
4       You are in a valley in the forest beside a stream tumbling along a
4       rocky bed.
5       You are in open forest, with a deep valley to one side.  Not far
5       is a large billboard.
6       You are in open forest near both a valley and a road.
7       At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a 2-inch slit
7       in the rock.  Downstream the streambed is bare rock.
8       You are in a 20-foot depression floored with bare dirt.  Set into the
8       dirt is a strong steel grate mounted in concrete.  A dry streambed
8       leads into the depression.
9       You are in a small chamber beneath a 3x3 steel grate to the surface.
9       A low crawl over cobbles leads inward to the west.
10      You are crawling over cobbles in a low passage.  There is a dim light
10      at the east end of the passage.
11      You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the surface.
11      A low wide passage with cobbles becomes plugged with mud and debris
11      here, but an awkward canyon leads upward and west.  A note on the wall
11      says "Magic Word XYZZY".
12      You are in an awkward sloping east/west canyon.  There is a small
12      hole in the north wall.
13      You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet high.  The walls are frozen
13      rivers of orange stone.  An awkward canyon and a good passage exit
13      from east and west sides of the chamber.
14      At your feet is a small pit breathing traces of white mist.  An east
14      passage ends here except for a small crack leading on.
15      You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of sight to
15      the west.  There are openings to either side.  Nearby, a wide stone
15      staircase leads downward.  The hall is filled with wisps of white mist
15      swaying to and fro almost as if alive.  A cold wind blows up the
15      staircase.  There is a passage at the top of a dome behind you.
16      The crack is far too small for you to follow.
17      You are on the east bank of a fissure slicing clear across the hall.
17      The mist is quite thick here, and the fissure is too wide to jump.
18      This is a low room with a crude note on the wall.  The note says,
18      "You won't get it up the steps".
19      You are in the Hall of the Mountain King, with passages off in all
19      directions.
20      You are at the bottom of the pit with a broken neck.
21      You didn't make it.
22      The dome is unclimbable.
23      You are at the west end of the Twopit Room.  There is a large hole in
23      the wall above the pit at this end of the room.
24      You are at the bottom of the eastern pit in the Twopit Room.  There is
24      a small pool of oil in one corner of the pit.
25      You are at the bottom of the western pit in the Twopit Room.  There is
25      a large hole in the wall about 25 feet above you.
26      You clamber up the plant and scurry through the hole at the top.
27      You are on the west side of the fissure in the Hall of Mists.
28      You are in a low N/S passage at a hole in the floor.  The hole goes
28      down to an E/W passage.
29      You are in the South Side Chamber.
30      You are in the West Side Chamber of the Hall of the Mountain King.
30      A passage continues west and up here.
31      >$<
32      You can't get by the snake.
33      You are in a large room, with a passage to the south, a passage to the
33      west, and a wall of broken rock to the east.  There is a large "Y2" on
33      a rock in the room's center.
34      You are in a jumble of rock, with cracks everywhere.
35      You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of
35      sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below.  Traces of
35      white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the right.
35      Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that
35      someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and
35      25 feet away there is a similar window looking into a lighted room.  A
35      shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.
36      You are in a dirty broken passage.  To the east is a crawl.  To the
36      west is a large passage.  Above you is a hole to another passage.
37      You are on the brink of a small clean climbable pit.  A crawl leads
37      west.
38      You are in the bottom of a small pit with a little stream, which
38      enters and exits through tiny slits.
39      You are in a large room full of dusty rocks.  There is a big hole in
39      the floor.  There are cracks everywhere, and a passage leading east.
40      You have crawled through a very low wide passage parallel to and north
40      of the Hall of Mists.
41      You are at the west end of Hall of Mists.  A low wide crawl continues
41      west and another goes north.  To the south is a little passage 6 feet
41      off the floor.
42      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
43      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.

55      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
56      Dead end.
57      You are on the brink of a thirty foot pit with a massive orange column
57      down one wall.  You could climb down here but you could not get back
57      up.  The maze continues at this level.
58      Dead end.
59      You have crawled through a very low wide passage parallel to and north
59      of the Hall of Mists.
60      You are at the east end of a very long hall apparently without side
60      chambers.  In the south wall are several wide cracks and a high
60      hole, but the hole is far above your head.  To the east a wide
60      crawl slants up.  To the north a round two foot hole slants down.
61      You are at the west end of a very long featureless hall.  The hall
61      joins up with a narrow north/south passage.
62      You are at a crossover of a high N/S passage and a low E/W one.
63      Dead end.
64      You are at a complex junction.  A low hands and knees passage from the
64      north joins a higher crawl from the east to make a walking passage
64      going west.  There is also a large room above.  The air is damp here.
65      You are in Bedquilt, a long east/west passage with holes everywhere.
65      To explore at random select north, south, up, or down.
66      You are in a room whose walls resemble swiss cheese.  Obvious passages
66      go west, east, NE, and NW.  Part of the room is occupied by a large
66      bedrock block.
67      You are at the east end of the Twopit Room.  The floor here is
67      littered with thin rock slabs, which make it easy to descend the pits.
67      There is a path here bypassing the pits to connect passages from east
67      and west.  There are holes all over, but the only big one is on the
67      wall directly over the west pit where you can't get to it.
68      You are in a large low circular chamber whose floor is an immense slab
68      fallen from the ceiling (Slab Room).  East and west there once were
68      large passages, but they are now filled with boulders.  Low small
68      passages go north and south, and the south one quickly bends west
68      around the boulders.
69      You are in a secret N/S canyon above a large room.
70      You are in a secret N/S canyon above a sizable passage.
71      You are in a secret canyon at a junction of three canyons, bearing
71      north, south, and SE.  The north one is as tall as the other two
71      combined.
72      You are in a large low room.  Crawls lead north, NE, and SW.
73      Dead end crawl.
74      You are in a secret canyon which here runs E/W.  It crosses over a
74      very tight canyon 15 feet below.  If you go down you may not be able
74      to get back up.
75      You are at a wide place in a very tight N/S canyon.
76      The canyon here becomes too tight to go further south.
77      You are in a tall E/W canyon.  A low tight crawl goes 3 feet north and
77      seems to open up.
78      The canyon runs into a mass of boulders -- dead end.
79      The stream flows out through a pair of 1 foot diameter sewer pipes.
79      It would be advisable to use the exit.
80      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
81      Dead end.
82      Dead end.

85      Dead end.
86      Dead end.
87      You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
88      You are in a long, narrow corridor stretching out of sight to the
88      west.  At the eastern end is a hole through which you can see a
88      profusion of leaves.
89      There is nothing here to climb.  Use "up" or "out" to leave the pit.
90      You have climbed up the plant and out of the pit.
91      You are at the top of a steep incline above a large room.  You could
91      climb down here, but you would not be able to climb up.  There is a
91      passage leading back to the north.
92      You are in the Giant Room.  The ceiling here is too high up for your
92      lamp to show it.  Cavernous passages lead east, north, and south.  On
92      the west wall is scrawled the inscription, "FEE FIE FOE FOO" [sic].
93      The passage here is blocked by a recent cave-in.
94      You are at one end of an immense north/south passage.
95      You are in a magnificent cavern with a rushing stream, which cascades
95      over a sparkling waterfall into a roaring whirlpool which disappears
95      through a hole in the floor.  Passages exit to the south and west.
96      You are in the Soft Room.  The walls are covered with heavy curtains,
96      the floor with a thick pile carpet.  Moss covers the ceiling.
97      This is the Oriental Room.  Ancient oriental cave drawings cover the
97      walls.  A gently sloping passage leads upward to the north, another
97      passage leads SE, and a hands and knees crawl leads east.
98      You are following a wide path around the outer edge of a large cavern.
98      Far below, through a heavy white mist, strange splashing noises can be
98      heard.  The mist rises up through a fissure in the ceiling.  The path
98      hugs the cavern's rim to the NE and south, while another branch forks
98      west.  A round chute with extremely smooth walls angles sharply up
98      to the southwest.
99      You are in an alcove.  A small NW path seems to widen after a short
99      distance.  An extremely tight tunnel leads east.  It looks like a very
99      tight squeeze.  An eerie light can be seen at the other end.
100     You're in a small chamber lit by an eerie green light.  An extremely
100     narrow tunnel exits to the west, and a dark corridor leads NE.
101     You're in the Dark-Room.  A corridor leading south is the only exit.
102     You are in an arched hall.  A coral passage once continued up and east
102     from here, but is now blocked by debris.  The air smells of sea water.
103     You're in a large room carved out of sedimentary rock.  The floor and
103     walls are littered with bits of shells imbedded in the stone.  A
103     shallow passage proceeds downward, and a somewhat steeper one leads
103     up.  A low hands and knees passage enters from the south.
104     You are in a long sloping corridor with ragged sharp walls.
105     You are in a cul-de-sac about eight feet across.
106     You are in an anteroom leading to a large passage to the east.  Small
106     passages go west and up.  The remnants of recent digging are evident.
106     A sign in midair here says "Cave under construction beyond this point.
106     Proceed at own risk.  [Witt Construction Company]".
107     You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all different.
108     You are at Witt's End.  Passages lead off in *ALL* directions.
109     You are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across.  The floor is
109     covered by white mist seeping in from the north.  The walls extend
109     upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspended from some unseen point far
109     above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and
109     midway between the canyon walls.  (The mirror is obviously provided
109     for the use of the dwarves, who as you know, are extremely vain.)  A
109     small window can be seen in either wall, some fifty feet up.
110     You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of
110     sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below.  Traces of
110     white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the left.
110     Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that
110     someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and
110     25 feet away there is a similar window looking into a lighted room.  A
110     shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.
111     A large stalactite extends from the roof and almost reaches the floor
111     below.  You could climb down it, and jump from it to the floor, but
111     having done so you would be unable to reach it to climb back up.
112     You are in a little maze of twisting passages, all different.
113     You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir.  An opaque cloud
113     of white mist fills the room and rises rapidly upward.  The lake is
113     fed by a stream, which tumbles out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet
113     overhead and splashes noisily into the water somewhere within the
113     mist.  The indistinct shape of the opposite shore can be dimly seen
113     through the mist.  The only passage goes back toward the south.
114     Dead end.
115     You are at the northeast end of an immense room, even larger than the
115     Giant Room.  It appears to be a repository for the "ADVENTURE"
115     program.  Massive torches far overhead bathe the room with smokey
115     yellow light.  Scattered about you can be seen a pile of bottles (all
115     of them empty), a nursery of young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed
115     of oysters, a bundle of black rods with rusty stars on their ends, and
115     a collection of brass lanterns.  Off to one side a great many dwarves
115     are sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly.  A sign nearby reads: "Do
115     not disturb the dwarves!"  An immense mirror is hanging against one
115     wall, and stretches to the other end of the room, where various other
115     sundry objects can be glimpsed dimly in the distance.  An unoccupied
115     telephone booth stands against the north wall.
116     You are at the southwest end of the repository.  To one side is a pit
116     full of fierce green snakes.  On the other side is a row of small
116     wicker cages, each of which contains a little sulking bird.  In one
116     corner is a bundle of black rods with rusty marks on their ends.  A
116     large number of velvet pillows are scattered about on the floor.  A
116     Beside one of the pillows is a large, dusty, leather-bound volume
116     with the title "History of Adventure" embossed in pure gold.
116     vast mirror stretches off to the northeast, almost reaching the
116     phone booth.  At your feet is a large steel grate, next to which is
116     a sign which reads, "Treasure Vault. Keys in Main Office."
117     You are on one side of a large, deep chasm.  A heavy white mist rising
117     up from below obscures all view of the far side.  A SW path leads away
117     from the chasm into a winding corridor.
118     You are in a long winding corridor sloping out of sight in both
118     directions.
119     You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
120     You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
121     You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
122     You are on the northeast side of a deep chasm.  A NE path leads away
122     from the chasm on this side.
123     You're in a long east/west corridor.  A faint rumbling noise can be
123     heard in the distance.
124     The path forks here.  The left fork leads northeast.  A dull rumbling
124     seems to get louder in that direction.  The right fork leads southeast
124     down a gentle slope.  The main corridor enters from the west.
125     The walls are quite warm here.  From the north can be heard a steady
125     roar, so loud that the entire cave seems to be trembling.  Another
125     passage leads south, and a low crawl goes east.
126     You are on the edge of a breath-taking view.  Far below you is an
126     active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging
126     out, cascading back down into the depths.  The glowing rock fills the
126     farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving every-
126     thing an eerie, macabre appearance.  The air is filled with flickering
126     sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to
126     the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other
126     sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted
126     formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky
126     light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep
126     gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to
126     have been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire
126     crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the
126     gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.  To
126     the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously
126     from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles
126     ominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its
126     own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the already
126     hellish scene.  A dark, foreboding passage exits to the south.
127     You are in a small chamber filled with large boulders.  The walls are
127     very warm, causing the air in the room to be almost stifling from the
127     heat.  The only exit is a crawl heading west, through which is coming
127     a low rumbling.
128     You are walking along a gently sloping north/south passage lined with
128     oddly shaped limestone formations.
129     You are standing at the entrance to a large, barren room.  A sign
129     posted above the entrance reads:  "Caution!  Bear in room!"
130     You are inside a barren room.  The center of the room is completely
130     empty except for some dust.  Marks in the dust lead away toward the
130     far end of the room.  The only exit is the way you came in.
131     You are in a maze of twisting little passages, all different.
132     You are in a little maze of twisty passages, all different.
133     You are in a twisting maze of little passages, all different.
134     You are in a twisting little maze of passages, all different.
135     You are in a twisty little maze of passages, all different.
136     You are in a twisty maze of little passages, all different.
137     You are in a little twisty maze of passages, all different.
138     You are in a maze of little twisting passages, all different.
139     You are in a maze of little twisty passages, all different.
140     Dead end.
141     You are on a narrow promontory at the foot of a waterfall, which
141     spurts from an overhead hole in the rock wall and splashes into a
141     large reservoir, sending up clouds of mist and spray.
141     Through the thick white mist looms a polished marble slab, to
141     which is affixed an enormous rusty iron anvil.  In golden letters
141     are written the words: "Whoso Pulleth Out This Sword of This
141     Stone and Anvil, is Rightwise King-Born of All This Mountain."
141     There is a narrow chimney on the east side of the promontory.
142     You are on a narrow shelf above and east of the top of a very steep
142     chimney.  A long smooth granite slide curves down out of sight
142     to the east.  If you go down the slide, you may not be able to
142     climb back up.
143     You are in the private chamber of the Mountain King.  Hewn into the
143     solid rock of the east wall of the chamber is an intricately-wrought
143     throne of elvish design.  There is an exit to the west.
144     You are on the east side of the throne room.  On the arm of the throne
144     has been hung a sign which reads "Gone for the day: visiting
144     sick snake. --M.K."
145     You are dragged down, down, into the depths of the whirlpool.
145     Just as you can no longer hold your breath, you are shot out over
145     a waterfall into the shallow end of a large reservoir.  Gasping
145     and sputtering, you crawl weakly towards the shore....
146     You are in dense forest, with a hill to one side.  The trees appear
146     to thin out towards the north and east.
147     You are at the high point of a wide grassy knoll, partially surrounded
147     by dense forest.  The land rises to the south and east, and drops off
147     sharply to the north and west.  The air smells of sea water.
148     You are at the edge of a trackless salt marsh.  Tall reeds obscure
148     the view.
149     You're in salt marsh.
150     You're in salty marsh.
151     You are in salt marsh.
152     Dead end.
153     You're on a sandy beach at the edge of the open sea.  The beach
153     streches out of sight to the south.  To the north, the beach ends
153     in cliffs and broken rocks.
154     You are at a jumble of large broken rocks.  A gentle path leads up
154     to the top of the nearby cliffs.  A narrow treacherous path
154     disappears among the rocks at the foot of the cliff.
155     You are on a high cliff overlooking the sea.  Far below the
155     rolling breakers smash into a jumble of large broken rocks.
155     The thunder of the surf is deafening.
156     You're at the bottom of the cliff, smashed to smithereens by the
156     pounding surf.
157     You are at Thunder Hole, a funnel shaped cavern opening onto the sea.
157     The noise of the surf pounding against the outer rocks of the cave is
157     amplified by the peculiar shape of the cave, causing a thunder-like
157     booming sound to reverberate throughout the cave.  Outside, a narrow
157     path leads south towards some large rocks.
158     You are at the top of some arched steps.  On one side is a blank wall
158     with a tiny door at the base and a shelf overhead.  On the other side
158     a westward passage leads to the sea.
159     You are in a low cramped chamber at the back of a small cave.
159     There is a shelf in the rock wall at about the height of your
159     shoulder.
160     You are on a wide ledge, bounded on one side by a rock wall,
160     and on the other by a sheer cliff.  The only way past is through
160     a large wrought-iron door.
161     You feel dizzy...Everything around you is spinning, expanding,
161     growing larger....  Dear me!  Is the cave bigger or are you smaller?
162     You are again overcome by a sickening vertigo, but this time
162     everything around you is shrinking...Shrinking...
163     You are again overcome by a sickening vertigo, but this time
163     everything is shrinking... I mean, you are growing.  This is
163     terribly confusing!
164     You feel dizzy...Everything around you is spinning, expanding,
164     growing larger....
165     You're at the bottom of the cliff with a broken neck.
166     You are at the western tip of the Blue Grotto.  A large lake almost
166     covers the cavern floor, except for where you are standing.  Small
166     holes high in the rock wall to the east admit a dim light.  The
166     reflection of the light from the water suffuses the cavern with
166     a hazy bluish glow.
167     You are on the shore of an underground sea.  A high wooden
167     structure of vast proportions extends out into the water to the
167     east.  The way west is through a wrought-iron door.
168     You are on the eastern shore of the Blue Grotto.  An ascending
168     tunnel disappears into the darkness to the SE.
169     You are at a high rock on the NE side of a watery chamber at the mouth
169     of a small brook.  An unknown gas bubbles up through the water from
169     the chamber floor.  A bluish light can be seen to the southwest.
170     You are in a windy tunnel between two large rooms.
171     You are in the Bat Cave.  The walls and ceiling are covered with
171     sleeping bats.  The floor is buried by a mass of dry, foul-smelling
171     guano.  The stench is overpowering.  Exits to the NW and east.
172     You are in a very tight N/S crack.  The passage seems to widen to
172     the south.
173     You are in a very tight N/S crack.  The passage south is blocked
173     by a recent cave-in.
174     You're in the Cloakroom.  This is where the dreaded Wumpus repairs
174     to sleep off heavy meals.  (Adventurers are his favorite dinner!)
174     Two very narrow passages exit NW and NE.
175     You're in a room containing several small climable pits.  Passages
175     exit to the east and north.
176     You are at the bottom of a small featureless pit.
177     You are at a high hole in a rock wall.
178     The NE passage is blocked by a recent cave-in.
179     You are in a sloping muddy defile, next to a tumbling brook.
180     You are in a level E/W passage partially blocked by an overhanging
180     tongue of rock.  A steep scramble would take you up over the tongue,
180     whence continues an upward crawl.
181     The dog won't let you pass.
182     You're in the Upper Passage, a long level E/W tunnel.
183     You are in a star-shaped chamber.  Passages exit north, east, south,
183     and west.
184     You are at an elbow in a winding E/W passage.
185     Dead end.
186     You're at the intersection of two long tunnels.  One goes NW,
186     the other NE.
187     You're in a long narrow east-west passage which curves out of sight
187     at both ends.
188     You're in the Rotunda.  Corridors radiate in all directions.
188     There is a telephone booth standing against the north wall.
189     You are standing in a telephone booth at the side of a large chamber.
189     Hung on the wall is a banged-up pay telephone of ancient design.
190     You're at the Devil's Chair, a large crystallization shaped like a
190     seat, at the edge of a black abyss.  You can't see the bottom.
190     An upward path leads away from the abyss.
191     You're in a dead-end crack.
192     You're on a small gravel beach at the south wall of the Blue Grotto.
192     A gravelly path leads east.
193     You are in the Flower Room.  The walls are covered with colorful,
193     intricate, flower-like patterns of crystallized gypsum.
194     You are at the end of a short E/W corridor.
195     You are looking west from the end of a short E/W corridor.  At your
195     feet is a pile of loose rubble.  On your left is a hole into another
195     chamber.
196     You are in an arched hall.  The remnants of a now-plugged coral
196     passage lie to the east.  The north wall has partially crumbled,
196     exposing a large connecting hole to another room.
197     You're in the Vestibule, a short passageway between two rooms.
198     You are in the Fairy Grotto.  All around you innumerable stalactites,
198     arranged in immense colonnades, form elegant arches.  On every side
198     you hear the dripping of water, like the footsteps of a thousand
198     fairies.  A small stream runs from the SW corner.  A bright glow
198     emanates from the south side of the grotto, and a steep passage
198     descends to the east.
199     You have approached the lower end of a steep passage, but it is
199     just too cold here to hang around, and you aren't properly equipped
199     to continue.  With teeth chattering, you climb back up....
200     You are in the Crystal Palace.  An overhead vein of phosphorescent
200     quartz casts a liminous glow which is reflected by countless chips of
200     mica embedded in both walls, which consist of some sort of highly
200     reflective glass, apparently of volcanic origin.  A winding path
200     of yellow sandstone leads west and rises steeply to the east.
201     You are following a yellow sandstone path.  There is a glow
201     to the west.
202     You are in a very tall chamber whose walls are comprised of many
202     different rock strata.  Layers of red and yellow sandstone
202     intertwine with bright bands of calcareous limestone in a rainbow-
202     like profusion of color.  The rainbow effect is so real, you
202     are almost tempted to look for a pot of gold!  Poised far over
202     your head, a gigantic slab, wedged tightly between the north and
202     south walls, forms a natural bridge across the roof of the chamber.
203     You're in a steeply sloping passage.  It is very cold here.
204     You are in the Hall of Ice, in the deepest part of the caverns.
204     During winter, frigid outside air settles here, making this room
204     extremely cold all year round.  The walls and ceilings are covered
204     with a thick coating of ice.  An upward passage exits to the west.
205     You are standing on a natural bridge far above the floor of a circular
205     chamber whose walls are a rainbow of multi-colored rock.  The bridge
205     was formed eons ago by a huge slab which fell from the ceiling and
205     is now jammed between the north and south walls of the chamber.
206     You are in a low, wide room below another chamber.  A small green
206     pond fills the center of the room.  The lake is apparently spring-
206     fed.  A small stream exits through a narrow passage to the north.
206     A larger passage continues west.
207     You are in a tight north/south crawl through a stratum of red
207     colored rock.  The air is damp with mist.
208     You are in a tall canyon on the south side of a swift, wide river.
208     Written in the mud in crude letters are the words: "You Have Found
208     Lost River."  A wide path leads west along the bank.  A tight
208     crawlway would take you out of the canyon.
209     You are standing on a large flat rock table at the western end of
209     Lost River Canyon.  Beneath your feet, the river disappears amidst
209     foam and spray into a large sinkhole.  A gentle path leads east
209     along the river's south shore.  Another leads sharply upward along
209     the river's north side.
210     You are at a niche in the canyon wall, far above a raging river.
210     The air is filled with mist and spray, making it difficult to see
210     ahead.  A downward sloping ledge narrows to the east.
211     The ledge is growing very narrow and treacherous, and falls off almost
211     vertically.  You could go down, but you won't be able to climb
211     back.
212     You are standing in a telephone booth at the side of the Repository.
213     You're at the east end of a level passage at a hole in the floor.
214     You're at the north edge of a dark cove.
215     You are in a dry granite basin, worn smooth eons ago by water
215     swirling down from a now-dry spillway.
216     You're in a dry spillway east of and above a smooth rock basin.
217     You are in the Winery, a cool dark room which extends some
217     distance off to the east.
218     You are to the east of the Winery, where the room ends in a thicket
218     of high, sharp, pointed, climable limestone pinnacles.  There is a
218     narrow ledge just above the top of the spires.  If you go up, it
218     might be difficult to get back down.
219     You are in a high-vaulted cavern whose roof rises over fifty
219     meters to culminate in a series of pointed arches directly over
219     your head.  There are also two low arches to either side, forming
219     side portals.  The whole effect is that of a gothic cathedral.
220     You're at the east portal of the Gothic Cathedral.
221     You're at the west portal of the Gothic Cathedral.
222     You are at the foot of the Altar, an immense, broad stalagmite.
223     You're on top of an enormous, broad stalagmite.  There is a hole
223     in the ceiling overhead.
224     You are in a room the size and shape of a small crypt.  A narrow
224     cut exits east.  There is a hole in the floor.
225     You are in an extremely bizzare room.  The entire north wall
225     glow with a luminous red light.  There are gnarled stone formations
225     rising from the floor, which look like contorted staues in the
225     wierd red light.  A bronze plaque on the east wall bears the
225     inscription, 'Shamut'.  There is a dark tunnel to the south and an
225     impossibly steep passage west.
226     You are on the floor of the Rainbow Room.  In fact, you are spread
226     *ALL OVER* the floor of the Rainbow Room.
227     You are in a dimly lit passage behind Thunder Hole.  Etched into
227     the rock wall are the ominous words:
227     *       "You are approaching the River Styx.      *
227     *        Laciate Ogni Speranza Voi Ch'Entrate."   *
228     You are at the River Styx, a narrow little stream cutting directly
228     across the passageway.  The edge of the stream is littered with sticks
228     and other debris washed in by a recent rainfall.  On the far side
228     of the river, the passage continues east.
229     You're on the east side of the river's sticks.
230     You are on a ledge at the northern end of a long N/S crawl.  The
230     ledge is above a large number of sharp vertical limestone spires.
230     An attempt to climb down could be dangerous, if you get my *point*!
231     You are very neatly skewered on the point of a sharp rock.
232     You have poled your boat across the calm water.
233     You have poled your boat across the dark water.
234     You have poled your boat across the Blue Grotto.
235     You're at Dante's Rest, on the north side of a yawning dark chasm.
235     A passage continues west along the chasm's edge.
236     You are at the east end of a riverbank path in Lost River Canyon.
237     The staircase is now unclimable.
238     You're in the caretaker's pantry.
239     You have entered Haunted Chamber.  A cold wind whistles eerily
239     throughout the room.  Strange chords from an unseen organ echo
239     from all over.  A passage leads east and a small hole leads south.
240     You are in a steep tunnel slanting down into the earth.  Faint
240     strains of organ music can be heard from above.  You cannot see
240     bottom.

1       Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in
1       treasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never
1       seen again.  Magic is said to work in the cave.  I will be your eyes
1       and hands.  Direct me with natural English commands.  I should warn
1       you that I look at only the first five letters of each word, so you'll
1       have to enter "Northeast" as "NE" to distinguish it from "North".
1       (Should you get stuck, type "HELP" or "?" for some general hints.)
1       Good Luck!
1       - - - -
2       A little dwarf with a big knife blocks your way.
3       A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you, threw a little
3       axe at you which missed, cursed, and ran away.
4       There is a threatening little dwarf in the room with you!
5       One sharp nasty knife is thrown at you!
6       None of them hit you!
7       One of them gets you!
8       A hollow voice says "Plugh".
9       There is no way to go that direction.
10      I am unsure how you are facing.  Use compass points or nearby objects.
11      I don't know in from out here.  Use compass points or name something
11      in the general direction you want to go.
12      I don't know how to apply that word here.
13      I don't understand that!
14      I'm game.  Would you care to explain how?
15      Sorry, but I am not allowed to give more detail.  I will repeat the
15      long description of your location.
16      It is now pitch dark.  If you proceed you will likely fall into a pit.
17      If you prefer, simply type "W" rather than "West".
18      Are you trying to catch the bird?
19      The bird is frightened right now and you cannot catch it no matter
19      what you try.  Perhaps you might try later.
20      Are you trying to somehow deal with the snake?
21      You can't kill the snake, or drive it away, or avoid it, or anything
21      like that.  There is a way to get by, but you don't have the necessary
21      resources right now.
22      Do you really want to quit now?
23      You fell into a pit and broke every bone in your body!
24      You are already carrying it!
25      You can't be serious!
26      The bird was unafraid when you entered, but as you approach it becomes
26      disturbed and you cannot catch it.
27      You can catch the bird, but you cannot carry it.
28      There is nothing here with a lock!
29      You aren't carrying it!
30      The little bird attacks the green snake, and in an astounding flurry
30      drives the snake away.
31      You have no keys!
32      It has no lock.
33      I don't know how to lock or unlock such a thing.
34      It was already locked.
35      The grate is now locked.
36      The grate is now unlocked.
37      It was already unlocked.
38      You have no source of light.
39      Your lamp is now on.
40      Your lamp is now off.
41      There is no way to get past the bear to unlock the chain, which is
41      probably just as well.
42      Nothing happens.
43      Where?
44      There is nothing here to attack.
45      The little bird is now dead.  Its body disappears.
46      Attacking the snake both doesn't work and is very dangerous.
47      You killed a little dwarf.
48      You attack a little dwarf, but he dodges out of the way.
49      With what?  Your bare hands?
50      Good try, but that is an old worn-out magic word.
51      I know of places, actions, and things.  Much of my vocabulary
51      describes places and is used to move you there.  To move, try words
51      like forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west, north, south,
51      up, or down.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod
51      hidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of
51      the action words that I know.  Usually you will need to give both the
51      object and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can infer
51      the object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in
51      particular, "INVENTORY" implies "TAKE INVENTORY", which causes me to
51      give you a list of what you're carrying.  The objects have side
51      effects; for instance, the rod scares the bird.  Usually people having
51      trouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Usually people
51      trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something
51      beyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely
51      different tack.  To speed the game you can sometimes move long
51      distances with a single word.  For example, "Building" usually gets
51      you to the building from anywhere above ground except when lost in the
51      forest or the marsh.  Also, note that cave passages turn a lot, and
51      that leaving a room to the north does not guarantee entering the
51      next from the south.  You'd best make yourself a map as you go along.
51      - - -
51      A word about my understanding of English -- I will try very hard to
51      do whatever you say, but here are a few suggestions.  To scarf up
51      everything movable at a given location, say 'TAKE EVERYTHING' or
51      'TAKE ALL'.  Some objects may be differentiated only by some attribute
51      or other.  For example, if you were holding both a red and a blue
51      frammitz, you would have to distinguish between them by typing
51      'RED FRAMMITZ' or 'BLUE FRAMMITZ' so that I'll know which one you
51      mean.   Also, you can specify several actions or objects by using
51      commas or 'AND', as 'TAKE ABC,DEF AND XYZ AND BURN WITCH'.

51      - - -
51      To list what you are currently holding, say "INVENTORY", or just "I".
51      - - -
51      To reprint the detailed description of where you are, say "LOOK"
51      or "L".  You can also "LOOK IN" or "LOOK AT" appropriate objects.
51      - - -
51      If you want to end your adventure early, say "QUIT".
51      - - -
51      To suspend your adventure such that you can continue later,
51      say "SUSPEND" (or "PAUSE" or "SAVE").
51      - - -
51      To see what hours the cave is normally open, say "HOURS".
51      - - -
51      To see how well you're doing, say "SCORE".  To get full credit for a
51      treasure, you must have left it safely in the building, though you get
51      partial credit just for locating it.  Note that leaving something
51      in a *safe* place may be trickier than you think!
51      You lose points for getting killed, or for quitting,
51      though the former costs you more.  There are also points
51      based on how much (if any) of the cave you've managed to
51      explore; in particular, there is a large bonus just for getting in (to
51      distinguish the dilletantes from the rest of the pack), and there are
51      other ways to determine whether you've been through some of the more
51      harrowing sections.  If you think you've found all the treasures, just
51      keep exploring for a while.  If nothing interesting happens, you
51      haven't found them all yet.  If something interesting *DOES* happen,
51      it means you're getting a bonus and have an opportunity to garner many
51      more points in the Master's Section.  I may occasionally offer hints
51      if you seem to be having trouble.  If I do, I'll warn you in advance
51      how much it will affect your score to accept the hints.
51      - - -
51      In addition to getting yourself killed, you can also be wounded or
51      injured in various (non-lethal) ways.  If you get burnt, poisoned,
51      electrocuted or whatever, you can check on your current state of
51      health by typing 'HEALTH' or 'DIAGNOSE'.  Note that recuperation
51      takes place faster outside in the fresh air!
51      - - -
51      This an exceedingly complex program and it's possible that something
51      may interact with something else in an unforseen way.  If you run
51      into something you think may be a program bug, or if you have any
51      ideas for extensions to the cave, type "GRIPE" (or "REPORT" or
51      "BITCH") and then enter as long a message as you like.  This will
51      be immediately transmitted to the Wizard, who will try to reply
51      within a day or two.
51      - - -
51      Finally, to save paper, you may specify "BRIEF", which tells me
51      never to repeat the full description of a place unless you explicitly
51      ask me to.  Experienced players may suppress *all* long-form
51      descriptions by typing "TERSE".  You can return to normal description
51      mode by typing "UNBRIEF" or "UNTERSE".
51      - - -
52      It misses!
53      It gets you!
54      Ok
55      You can't unlock the keys.
56      You have crawled around in some little holes and wound up back in the
56      main passage.
57      I don't know where the cave is, but hereabouts no stream can run on
57      the surface for long.  I would try the stream.
58      I need more detailed instructions to do that.
59      I can only tell you what you see as you move about and manipulate
59      things.  I cannot tell you where remote things are.
60      I can't make any sense out of that.
61      What?
62      Are you trying to get into the cave?
63      The grate is very solid and has a hardened steel lock.  You cannot
63      enter without a key, and there are no keys nearby.  I would recommend
63      looking elsewhere for the keys.
64      The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple, with an
64      occasional grove of pine or spruce.  There is quite a bit of under-
64      growth, largely birch and ash saplings plus nondescript bushes of
64      various sorts.  This time of year visibility is quite restricted by
64      all the leaves, but travel is quite easy if you detour around the
64      spruce and berry bushes.
65      Welcome to ADVENTURE!!  Would you like instructions?
66      Digging without a shovel is quite impractical.  Even with a shovel
66      progress is unlikely.
67      Blasting requires dynamite.
68      I'm as confused as you are.
69      Mist is a white vapor, usually water, seen from time to time in
69      caverns.  It can be found anywhere but is frequently a sign of a deep
69      pit leading down to water.
70      Your feet are now wet.
71      I think I just lost my appetite.
72      Thank you, it was delicious!
73      You have taken a drink from the stream.  The water tastes strongly of
73      minerals, but is not unpleasant.  It is extremely cold.
74      The bottle is now empty.
75      Rubbing the electric lamp is not particularly rewarding.  Anyway,
75      nothing exciting happens.
76      Peculiar.  Nothing unexpected happens.
77      Your bottle is empty and the ground is wet.
78      You can't pour that.
79      Watch it!
80      Which way?
81      Oh dear, you seem to have gotten yourself killed.  I might be able to
81      help you out, but I've never really done this before.  Do you want me
81      to try to reincarnate you?
82      All right.  But don't blame me if something goes wr......
82      *                    --- POOF!! ---                    *
82      You are engulfed in a cloud of orange smoke.  Coughing and gasping,
82      you emerge from the smoke and find....
83      You clumsy oaf, you've done it again!  I don't know how long I can
83      keep this up.  Do you want me to try reincarnating you again?
84      Okay, now where did I put my orange smoke?....  >POOF!<
84      Everything disappears in a dense cloud of orange smoke.
85      Now you've really done it!  I'm out of orange smoke!  You don't expect
85      me to do a decent reincarnation without any orange smoke, do you?
86      Okay, if you're so smart, do it yourself!  I'm leaving!

91      Sorry, but I no longer seem to remember how it was you got here.
92      It's too heavy.  You'll have to drop something first.
93      You can't go through a locked steel grate!
94      I believe what you want is right here with you.
95      You don't fit through a two-inch slit!
96      I respectfully suggest you go across the bridge instead of jumping.
97      There is no way across the fissure.
98      You're not carrying anything.
99      You are currently holding the following:
100     It's not hungry (it's merely pinin' for the fjords).  Besides, you
100     have no bird seed.
101     The snake has now devoured your bird.
102     There's nothing here it wants to eat (except perhaps you).
103     You fool, dwarves eat only coal!  Now you've made him *REALLY* mad!!
104     Your cask is empty and the ground is soaked.
105     You aren't carrying them!
106     I don't need to, thank you.
107     The ground is wet and the air is smelly.
108     Your lamp is now on, but the glare from the walls is absolutely
108     blinding.  If you proceed you are likely to fall into a pit.
109     You haven't any matches.
110     Don't be ridiculous!
111     The door is extremely rusty and refuses to open.
112     The plant indignantly shakes dry its leaves and asks, "Water?"
113     The hinges are quite thoroughly rusted now and won't budge.
114     The oil has freed up the hinges so that the door will now move,
114     although it requires some effort.
115     The plant has exceptionally deep roots and cannot be pulled free.
116     The dwarves' knives vanish as they strike the walls of the cave.
117     Something you're carrying won't fit through the tunnel with you.
117     You'd best take inventory and drop something.
118     You can't fit this five-foot clam through that little passage!
119     You can't fit this five-foot oyster through that little passage!
120     I advise you to put down the clam before opening it.  >Strain!<
121     I advise you to put down the oyster before opening it.  >Wrench!<
122     You don't have anything strong enough to open the clam.
123     You don't have anything strong enough to open the oyster.
124     A glistening pearl falls out of the clam and rolls away.  Goodness,
124     this must really be an oyster.  (I never was very good at identifying
124     bivalves.)  Whatever it is, it has now snapped shut again.
125     The oyster creaks open, revealing nothing but oyster inside.  It
125     promptly snaps shut again.
126     You have crawled around in some little holes and found your way
126     blocked by a recent cave-in.  You are now back in the main passage.
127     There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.
128     Out from the shadows behind you pounces a bearded pirate!  "Har, har,"
128     he chortles, "I'll just take all this booty and hide it away with me
128     chest deep in the maze!"  He snatches your treasure and vanishes into
128     the gloom.
129     A sepulchral voice reverberating through the cave, says, "Cave closing
129     soon.  All adventurers exit immediately through Main Office."
130     A mysterious recorded voice groans into life and announces:
130        "This exit is closed.  Please leave via Main Office."
131     It looks as though you're dead.  Well, seeing as how it's so close to
131     closing time anyway, I think we'll just call it a day.
132     The sepulchral voice entones, "The cave is now closed."  As the echoes
132     fade, there is a blinding flash of light (and a small puff of orange
132     smoke). . . .    As your eyes refocus, you look around and find...
133     There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
133     wall, burying the dwarves in the rubble.  You march through the hole
133     and find yourself in the Main Office, where a cheering band of
133     friendly elves carry the conquering adventurer off into the sunset.
134     There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
134     wall, burying the snakes in the rubble.  A river of molten lava pours
134     in through the hole, destroying everything in its path, including you!
135     There is a loud explosion, and you are suddenly splashed across the
135     walls of the room.
136     The resulting ruckus has awakened the dwarves.  There are now several
136     threatening little dwarves in the room with you!  Most of them throw
136     knives at you!  All of them get you!
137     Oh, leave the poor unhappy bird alone.
138     I daresay whatever you want is around here somewhere.
139     I'm not sure what you mean by "Stop".  Use "Quit" if you want to give
139     up.
140     You can't get there from here.
141     You are being followed by a very large, tame bear.
142     -          *** THE HISTORY OF ADVENTURE (ABRIDGED) ***          -
142     -                    ** By Ima Wimp **                      -
142     ADVENTURE was originally developed by William Crowther, and later
142     substantially rewritten and expanded by Don Woods at Stanford Univ.
142     According to legend, Crowther's original version was modelled on an
142     a real cavern, called Colossal Cave, which is a part of Kentucky's
142     Mammoth Caverns.  That version of the game included the main maze
142     and a portion of the third-level (Complex Junction - Bedquilt -
142     Swiss Cheese rooms, etc.), but not much more.
142     - - -
142     Don Woods and some others at Stanford later rewrote portions of
142     the original program, and greatly expanded the cave.  That version
142     of the game is recognizable by the maximum score of 350 points.
142     At this writing (November, 1978), that version is by far the most
142     widely known.
142     - - -
142     The latest additions were done throughout 1978 by David Long while
142     at the University of Chicago, Graduate School of Business.
142     Long's additions include the seaside entrance and all of
142     the cave on the "far side" of Lost River (Rainbow Rm - Crystal
142     Palace - Blue Grotto - Rotunda - beyond Joshua's wall, etc., etc.).
142     The current cave is about 50% larger than the Woods/Stanford model.
142     In the process, the code was heavily rewritten to permit more
142     generalized handling of objects and to allow a far more complex
142     syntax.  The current maximum score is 501 points.
142     - - -
142     Except for a couple of trivial subroutines (to get user-ID's for
142     logging purposes), ADVENTURE is written entirely in FORTRAN.  This
142     not because Crowther/Woods/Long love FORTRAN, but because it is
142     almost infinitely portable.  There were indeed moments when it took
142     great strength to withstand the temptation to whip out some character
142     handling routine in MACRO, instead of the furshlugginer compiler.
142     For example, there is an excellent rival game to Adventure, called
142     DUNGEON, developed at M.I.T., which is totally non-portable since
142     it is coded in an obscure variant of two initially obscure compilers,
142     and can only be transported in executable form between DEC-10's
142     and 20's.
142     - - -
142     Those interested in obtaining the latest releases of either the
142     source (FORTRAN IV) or executable code (DEC-20) should contact:
142     David E. Long, GSB Computing Services, University of Chicago,
142     5836 S. Greenwood Ave, Chicago IL 60637,  (312) 753-4290.
142     To determine how out of date your version is, check the release date
142     and number printed in the opening line of each game.  The version
142     number is parsed thusly: Version (say) 5.1/6 is major version 5,

142     release 1, bugfix 6.  The release number is changed only when the
142     cave mapping is altered or when new items are added.  The major
142     version number is incremented after adding extensions large enough
142     to affect the overall flavor of the game.  To whet curious appetites,
142     major version 6 is projected to appear sometime around the summer
142     of 1979.  It will contain a whole new wing to the cave (natch!)
142     plus a much enlarged surface area, including the Great Serbonian
142     Bog, the Castle of Aldor and the terrifying Passage of Fire.
142     Stay tuned!

142     Thanks are owed to Roger Matus and David Feldman, both of U. of C.,
142     for several suggestions, including the Rainbow Room, the telephone
142     booth and the fearsome Wumpus.  Further thanks go to J. R. Carlson
142     for many debugging suggestions.  Most thanks (and apologies)
142     go to Thomas Malory, Charles Dodgson, the Grimm Brothers, Dante,
142     Homer, Frank Baum and especially Anon., the real authors of ADVENTURE.
142     - - - -
143     Do you indeed wish to quit now?
144     There is nothing here with which to fill the vase.
145     The sudden change in temperature has delicately shattered the vase.
146     It is beyond your power to do that.
147     I don't know how.
148     It is too far up for you to reach.
149     You killed a little dwarf.  The body vanishes in a cloud of greasy
149     black smoke.
150     The shell is very strong and is impervious to attack.
151     What's the matter, can't you read?  Now you'd best start over.
152     The axe bounces harmlessly off the dragon's thick scales.
153     The dragon looks rather nasty.  You'd best not try to get by.
154     The little bird attacks the green dragon, and in an astounding flurry
154     gets burnt to a cinder.  The ashes blow away.
155     On what?
156     Okay, from now on I'll only describe a place in full the first time
156     you come to it.  To get the full description, say "LOOK".
157     Trolls are close relatives with the rocks and have skin as tough as
157     that of a rhinoceros.  The troll fends off your blows effortlessly.
158     The troll deftly catches the axe, examines it carefully, and tosses it
158     back, declaring, "Good workmanship, but it's not valuable enough."
159     The troll catches your treasure and scurries away out of sight.
160     The troll refuses to let you cross.
161     There is no longer any way across the chasm.
162     Just as you reach the other side, the bridge buckles beneath the
162     weight of the bear, which was still following you around.  You
162     scrabble desperately for support, but as the bridge collapses you
162     stumble back and fall into the chasm.
163     The bear lumbers toward the troll, who lets out a startled shriek and
163     scurries away.  The bear soon gives up the pursuit and wanders back.
164     The axe misses and lands near the bear where you can't get at it.
165     With what?  Your bare hands?  Against *HIS* bear hands??
166     The bear is confused; he only wants to be your friend.
167     For crying out loud, the poor thing is already dead!
168     The bear eagerly licks up the honeycomb, after which he seems to calm
168     down considerably and even becomes rather friendly.
169     The bear is still chained to the wall.
170     The chain is still locked.
171     The chain is now unlocked.
172     The chain is now locked.
173     There is nothing here to which the chain can be locked.
174     There is nothing here to eat.
175     Do you want the hint?
176     Do you need help getting out of the maze?
177     You can make the passages look less alike by dropping things.
178     Are you trying to explore beyond the Plover Room?
179     There is a way to explore that region without having to worry about
179     falling into a pit.  None of the objects available is immediately
179     useful in discovering the secret.
180     Do you need help getting out of here?
181     Don't go west.
182     Gluttony is not one of the troll's vices.  Avarice, however, is.
183     Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best start wrapping this up, unless
183     you can find some fresh batteries.  I seem to recall there's a vending
183     machine in the maze.  Bring some coins with you.
184     Your lamp has run out of power.
185     There's not much point in wandering around out here, and you can't
185     explore the cave without a lamp.  So let's just call it a day.
186     There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.  As you
186     turn toward them, the beam of your lamp falls across a bearded pirate.
186     He is carrying a large chest.  "Shiver me timbers!", he cries, "I've
186     been spotted!  I'd best hie meself off to the maze to hide me chest!"
186     With that, he vanishes into the gloom.
187     Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best replace those batteries.
188     Your lamp is now shining with renewed strength.
189     Your lamp is getting dim, and you haven't any more coins.  You'd
189     best start wrapping this up.
190     I'm afraid the magazine is written in dwarvish.
191     "This is not the maze where the pirate leaves his treasure chest."
192     Hmmm, this looks like a clue, which means it'll cost you 10 points to
192     read it.  Should I go ahead and read it anyway?
193     It says, "There is something strange about this place, such that one
193     of the words I've always known now has a new effect."
194     It says the same thing it did before.
195     I'm afraid I don't understand.
196     "Congratulations on bringing light into the dark-room!"
197     You strike the mirror a resounding blow, whereupon it shatters into a
197     myriad tiny fragments.
198     You have taken the vase and hurled it delicately to the ground.
199     You prod the nearest dwarf, who wakes up grumpily, takes one look at
199     you, curses, and grabs for his axe.
200     Is this acceptable?
201     There's no point in suspending a demonstration game.
202     You managed to climb about halfway up before losing your hold and
202     sliding back.
203     You were only a few yards from the top when you slipped and tumbled
203     all the way back down.
204     Ok, ok.  No need to be grabby.
205     Pulling an angry bear around is a good way to get your arm ripped off.
206     The sword is now very clean.
207     The sword is now covered with oil.
208     The handle is now too slippery to grasp.
209     You have no scabbord!
210     You are already wearing it!
211     Do you want to extract the sword from the anvil?
212     If you could convince me of your royal blood, you might get somewhere.
213     Are you trying to go up the slide?
214     Maybe you'd better look for another way into the cave.
215     You grasp the sword's handle and pull, but the sword won't budge.
215     Do you want to try yanking it out?
216     A tiny elf runs straight at you, shouts "Phuce!", and
216     disappears into the forest.
217     You can't swim.  You'd best go by boat.
218     The boat's oars were stolen by the dwarves to play bing-bong.
218     (That's dwarvish ping-pong -- with rocks!).  You have no way
218     to propel the boat.
219     You are still in the boat.  It is too heavy to carry.
220     You had better leave the boat first.
221     You are now sitting in a small boat.
222     You couldn't possibly cross this sea without a large ship.
223     The cliff is unscalable.
224     Your keys are all too large for the lock.
225     The wall is too smooth to climb.
226     The shelf is beyond your reach.
227     You are already wearing them!
228     You thought maybe these were peyote??  You feel a little dizzy,
228     but nothing happens.
229     You are growing taller, expanding like a telescope!  Just before
229     your head strikes the top of the chamber, the mysterious process
229     stops as suddenly as it began.
230     You are closing up like an accordian....shrinking..shrinking.  You
230     are now your normal size.
231     You have smashed your bottle all over the ground.
232     You are now too big to leave the way you came in.
233     This is obviously an elfin entrance.  Unless you can squeeze
233     yourself through a six-inch door, you'll have to find another
233     way into the cave.
234     The wrought-iron door is now locked.
235     The tiny door is now locked.
236     The wrought-iron door is now unlocked.
237     The tiny door is now unlocked.
238     You are blocked by a wall of solid rock.
239     >$<
240     The Wumpus looks at the food with distaste.  He looks at *YOU* with
240     relish!
241     You have jerked the cloak free of the rocks.  However, in doing
241     so you have caused a small rockslide, blocking the entrance
241     and making an unholy din.
242     The cloak is stuck tight under the rocks.  You'll probably have to
242     yank it out.
243     The Wumpus grabs the axe, stops and picks his teeth with it for a few
243     moments while looking thoughtfully at you.  When he finishes picking
243     his teeth, he eats the axe, belches, farts... and starts after
243     you again!
244     As the bridge disappears, the Wumpus scrambles frantically to reach
244     your side of the fissure.  He misses by inches, and with a horrible
244     shriek plunges to his death in the depths of the fissure!
245     You can't even hit a sleeping Wumpus!  The axe is now lying too near
245     the Wumpus for you to retrieve it.
246     The Wumpus is between you and the axe.  You can't reach it.
247     You can't fit through a six-inch door!
248     The dog easily dodges the axe, which lands beyond him where you can't
248     get at it.
249     The dog wolfs (natch) down the food and looks around hungrily for
249     more.  However, he does not appear to be any better disposed towards
249     your presence.
250     You've got to be kidding!
251     It's attached to the wall!
252     You can't put a thing into itself!
253     The gnome firmly blocks the door of the booth.  You can't enter.
254     The constant ringing has awakened the dwarves!
254     There are now several threatening little dwarves in the room with
254     you!  Most of them throw knives at you!  All of them get you!
255     The telephone is out of order.
256     The telephone is out of order and your hand is sore.
257     A couple of lead slugs drop from the coinbox.  (Gnomes are
257     notoriously cheap....)  But you've broken the phone beyond
257     all hope.
258     He wants treasure, not gab.
259     He didn't say anything!
260     It isn't a parrot.  He didn't say anything.
261     No one replies.  The line goes dead with a faint "Click".
262     I think you are a little confused!
263     As you move towards the phone booth, a gnome suddenly streaks
263     around the corner, jumps into the booth and rudely slams the door
263     in your face.  You can't get in.
264     He isn't hungry.
265     As the blast of the horn reverberates through the chamber, the
265     seemingly solid rock wall crumbles away, revealing another room just
265     beyond.  The wall was most likely worn thin by an ancient watercourse
265     which dried up just before completely wearing away the rock.
266     The chamber reverberates to the blast of the horn.
266     (Satchmo you ain't!)
267     The bees swarm over the fresh flowers, leaving the hive unguarded
267     and revealing a sweet honeycomb.
268     You are now out of breath.
269     It isn't ringing!
270     A hairy paw reaches out of the darkness and....
271     You don't have the correct change.
272     You go a short way down the bright passage, but the light
272     grows to blinding intensity.  You can't continue.
273     You know, if you type "BRIEF", I won't have to keep repeating these
273     long descriptions of each room.
274     Are you trying to reach the natural bridge?
275     You can't get to it by climbing the walls or jumping or anything
275     like that.  You could always put in a telephone call to the local
275     spelunking club for advice, if you could find a phone.
276     You turkey!!!  Now you've done it!  It took some effort, but you
276     woke up the Wumpus.  He slowly opens one red eye, and then another,
276     and then one more (!!), and looks at you sleepily.  He had been
276     dreaming of a late snack.  If you don't act quickly, you'll
276     be a *late* adventurer!
277     The blast of your horn echos throughout hill and dale.
278     All you have are watercress sandwiches.  The bear is less than
278     interested.
279     You have smashed your sword to smithereens against a rock.
280     Setting yourself adrift in the boat with no way to propel it would
280     not be very smart.  Best to keep the pole.
281     You're already in it!
282     You've hit the jackpot!!  Hundreds of coins and slugs cascade from
282     the telephone's coin return slot and spill all over the floor of
282     the booth.
283     Whoops!  The floor has opened out from under you!  It seems you
283     have fallen into a bottomless pit.  As a matter of fact, you're
283     still falling!  Well, I have better things to do than wait around
283     for you to strike bottom, so let's just assume you're dead.
283     Sorry about that, Chief.
284     The telephone in the booth has begun to ring.
285     I don't understand what you are trying to do!
286     How do you propose to cross the river?
287     The air is filled with beautiful music.
288     The air fills with beautiful music.  The dog gradually becomes
288     less fierce, and after a short while he lies down by the side of
288     the cavern and falls into a deep sleep.
289     Are you trying to get past the dog?
290     The only person I can remember who managed to get past the dog
290     was that singer, ummm, what's his name... Euridice's friend....
291     That wouldn't be wise.  It is best to let sleeping dogs lie.
292     The stream flows out of one very small crack and into another.
292     You can't go that way.
293     The river is too wide and deep to cross.
294     The glare is absolutely blinding.  If you proceed you are likely
294     to fall into a pit.
295     The hum of the bees rises to an angry buzz as you move towards
295     the hive.
296     The sticks and branches are all in a tangle and are stuck in the
296     mud.  You'd need a shovel to dig them out.
297     You're already carrying them!
298     The chalice is slightly cracked.  It won't hold any liquids.
299     The cask is now empty.
300     The wine goes right to your head.  You reel around in a drunken
300     stupor and finally pass out.  You awaken with a splitting headache,
300     and try to focus your eyes....
301     Yeeeecchhh!!
302     Your bottle is already full.
303     The cask is already full.
304     There is nothing here with which to fill the bottle.
305     There is nothing here which you would want to put into the cask.
306     Your bottle is now full of water.
307     The cask is now full of water.
308     Your bottle is now full of oil.
309     The cask is now full of oil.
310     The bottle is now full of wine.
311     The cask is now full of wine.
312     You have nothing in which to carry it.
313     You can't fill that.
314     Do you want it in the bottle or the cask?
315     Your containers are both full.
316     It's empty.
317     Hmmm, I see you have already gone through an extra set of batteries.
317     I'll get rid of the trash for you.
318     The bridge shakes as you cross.  Large hunks of clay and rock near
318     the edge break off and hurtle far down into the chasm.  Several of
318     the cracks on the bridge surface widen perceptibly.
319     The load is too much for the bridge!  With a roar, the entire
319     structure gives way, plunging you headlong into the raging river at
319     the bottom of the chasm and scattering all your holdings.  As the
319     icy waters close over your head, you flail and thrash with all your
319     might, and with your last ounce of strength pull yourself onto the
319     south bank of the river.
320     You can't get at him.  He is inside the phone booth.
321     Your lamp is already on.
322     Your lamp is already off.
323     Your lamp is again growing dim.  You'd better get some more batteries.
324     You know, you are wasting your batteries by wandering around out
324     here with your light on.

326     Dead wumpi, as a rule, are light eaters.  Nothing happens.
327     How do expect to feed a sleeping Wumpus?
328     You aren't holding it!
329     It won't fit!
330     The coin drops into the slot with a dull "clunk".  There is no
330     dial tone.
331     It's already there.
332     Thank you for your comments.  They will be dispatched immediately
332     via Gnome Express to the Wizard.
333     The chest is now unlocked.
334     The chest is now locked.
335     You can't get at it.
336     It's already open.
337     It's locked.
338     It's already closed.
339     You can't fill that.  It would leak all over the place.
340     It's not inside anything.
341     It isn't there!
342     How?
343     Taken.
344     Dropped.
345     I don't think I can.
346     Interesting.  How?
347     Huh?
348     You are in perfect health.
349     You are fit as a fiddle.
350     Only wizards can do that!
351     Are you kidding?  Do you want to suffocate the poor thing?
352     Thrown.
353     Left.
354     You can't get close enough for a clean thrust.
355     As you move in for the kill, the dwarf neatly slips a knife
355     between your ribs.
356     As you approach, the dwarf slashes out with his knife!
357     It's too dark to see anything!
358     It's not open.
359     There's nothing inside.
360     It contains:
361     The billboard reads:
361     "Visit Beautiful Colossal Cave.  Open Year Around.  Fun for
361     the entire family, or at least for those who survive."
361     Below the headline is an impossibly complicated map showing how
361     to find Colossal Cave.  Not that it matters, because all the
361     directions are written in Elvish.
362     Hidden behind the poster is a steel safe, embedded in the wall.
363     Brushing the dust from one of the larger rocks reveals some carved
363     characters.
364     Enough dusting, already!  You're making me sneeze.
365     The safe door smoothly swings open.
366     Maybe if you rubbed your fingertips with sandpaper....
367     The safe's door clicks shut.
368     This is a combination safe.  The keys won't help.
369     I certainly can't read in this light.
370     The poster has on it a picture of a short, fat wizard with a bushy
370     red beard and a white painted face.  He is playing an electric
370     guitar.  The caption reads:  'LOOK OUT KISS!!  Here comes WIZZ!!!!
370     Brian Baas lead singer and vocals.  Playing at a Woodstock
370     near you!'
371     "Click."
372     In the rock is carved the message "7-22-34".
373     You can't get at them.
374     Ok, I'll give you the full description whenever you enter a room
374     for the first time.
375     You don't have the right key.
376     That's not strong enough to open the clam.
377     That's not strong enough to open the oyster.
378     As you approach, the spider's grin widens.  I wouldn't proceed
378     any further.
379     The spider grabs the fly, wraps it silk, and proceeds to quietly
379     munch on it, leaving the door unguarded.

381     You are a bit off top form, but nothing to worry about.
382     You are weaker than usual.  Better avoid fights.
383     You really ought to take a break.  You're in tough shape.
384     You are on the edge of collapse.  Lots of sun and fresh air will
384     speed your recovery.
385     Your strength is nearly gone.  Only a miracle can save you now.
386     It reads (in intricate design): 'Shamut'

391     Is it hot in here?  You are flushed and sweating.
392     You are feeling definitely peculiar, weak....
393     You're dizzy, nauseous.  You can barely stand.
394     You are really ill.  If you don't find an antidote soon, it's
394     curtains.
395     You are a walking wound.  You are very weak.  You'd better find out
395     what's wrong before it's too late.
396     Sheeesh!  What a mess!  Your hair has fallen out and your skin is
396     covered with blisters.  And not an asprin in sight!
397     Well, you tried, but your strength is gone.  The agony is finally
397     over.
398     The fly buzzes his last buzz and takes a nosedive.
399     Suddenly, one of the stone contortions comes to life!  It is
399     an old, lethargic ogre, who ambles toward you and hands you an
399     old scrap of parchment.  He then disappears before your very eyes!

1       A large cloud of green smoke appears in front of you.  It clears away
1       to reveal a tall wizard, clothed in grey.  He fixes you with a steely
1       glare and declares, "This adventure has lasted too long."  With that
1       he makes a single pass over you with his hands, and everything around
1       you fades away into a grey nothingness.
2       Even wizards have to wait longer than that!
3       I'm terribly sorry, but Colossal Cave is closed.  Our hours are:
4       Only wizards are permitted within the cave right now.
5       We do allow visitors to make short explorations during our off hours.
5       Would you like to do that?
6       Colossal Cave is open to regular adventurers at the following hours:
7       Very well.
8       Only a wizard may continue an adventure this soon.
9       I suggest you resume your adventure at a later time.
10      Do you wish to see the hours?
11      Do you wish to change the hours?
12      New magic word (null to leave unchanged):
13      New magic number (null to leave unchanged):
14      Do you wish to change the message of the day?
15      Okay.  You can save this version now.
16      Are you a wizard?
17      Prove it!  Say the magic word!
18      That is not what I thought it was.  Do you know what I thought it was?
19      Oh dear, you really *ARE* a wizard!  Sorry to have bothered you . . .
20      Foo, you are nothing but a charlatan!
21      New hours specified by defining "Prime Time".  Give only the hour
21      (e.g. 14, Not 14:00 or 2pm).  Enter a negative number after last pair.
22      New hours for Colossal Cave:
23      Limit each line to 70 chars.  End with a blank line.
24      Line too long, retype:
25      Not enough room for another line.  Ending message here.
26      Do you wish to (re)schedule the next holiday?
27      To begin how many days from today?
28      To last how many days (zero if no holiday)?
29      To be called what (up to 20 characters)?
30      Too small!  Assuming minimum value (45 minutes).
31      Break out of this and save your core-image.
32      Be sure to save your core-image...
33      Do you need a new map?
34      There is water here.
35      There is oil here.
36      There is wine (hic) here.
