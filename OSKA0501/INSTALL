Requirements
============

This games has been ported to GNU g77, you should be okay with g77
2.95 and later, but if you run into problems (other than the prefix
problem, see below) try the lates version of g77 (should be
3.something)

This game also assumes a unix system (file name conventions) and no
garantee is made for a working installation on other systems.  But it
is possible to run the game in the src directory, which should work
everywhere.

Installation
============

To make this game do:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

This will (by default) put the game in /usr/local/bin
and the adventure file in /usr/local/share/games

You can specify another prefix with:

  ./configure --prefix=/some/path/here

in which case the game will be in /some/path/here/bin
and the adventure file in /some/path/here/share/games

WARNING: SPECIFYING TOO LONG PREFIX CAN RESULT IN COMPILATION ERROR!!!
This is a limitation of FORTRAN 77, that I'm not sure how to deal
with.  If you run into problems when specifying a prefix, try
something that is not much longer than /usr/local

To remove any object files, you can do `make clean'.  If you want to
remove also those files that `configure' generated do `make distclean'
