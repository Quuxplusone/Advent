Yes copyright stuff....

This is a difficult issue, as no copyright statements are in the
FORTRAN IV sources.  Adventure has traditionlly been treated as public
domain but copyright issue is a mess and will continue to be a mess :/

That said, I place a copyright on my code, and modifications and grant
you (as a user of the game) a right to play, to modify and to
distribute this in any manner whatsoever.

I was thinking of excluding commercial use, but if you succeed in
selling this, be my guest :)  Please let me know if you do.

WARRANTY

There is none.  Whatsoever.  You can read the code, and therefore
assume all responsability for this games actions.  INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO LOSS OF HEALTH, HOMEWORK, AND VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS.

There possibly should be a statement about fitness, but I don't think
this game is fit for anything at the moment :)
